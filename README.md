# Opinion-and-suggestion-mining
In this project, our aim is to develop a machine learning algorithm for opinion and suggestion mining. We have designed our model for two types of audiences, namely customers and organizations. Customers can receive the percentage of positive and negative reviews, based on which they can take appropriate actions. Similarly, organizations will receive the percentage of positive and negative reviews, along with improvement tips for their product/service. The algorithm will be trained on a large dataset of text reviews and will be able to classify the sentiment of the text as either positive or negative and print their percentages.

To accomplish this task, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. We will preprocess the text data to remove noise and extract relevant features such as word frequencies and sentiment indicators. Based on this, we will provide accurate results to our audiences.

The final product of this project will be a software tool that can automatically analyze the sentiment of a text dataset and provide improvement tips to the user. This tool will be useful for customers, businesses, and organizations that want to monitor customer feedback, as well as researchers who are interested in analyzing large amounts of text data.
