"Don't go with the negative reviews. Just go for it at the given price. Superb performance superb clarity and sound. Awesome connectivity.  Nothing is lacking in this model. I bought 55' model.  I think flipkart is a best plateform to buy electronic devices.  Thanks specially the seller, demo and installation team as the six movement wall mount provided is of very good quality, courier service and  above all,Flipkart for providing me the product at my door step."
Great TV for good price.Thank you LG for a wonderful experience
Overall ok
Picture quality is ok
excellent quality and sound feel like theatre
"Very nice product. But comes without magic remote. I am still in a dilemma that i will get magic remote to purchase separately or not. Local LG service centre doesn't have stock, even said this model is not compatible with magic remote. Flipkart customer care doesn't know about it. LG customer care is confirming that magic remote will work. So am still confused. Otherwise product is amazing."
"Value for money, good picture &sound quality  üëå, but installation poparlly not done,I tried flipcart  customer care &lg custer care not supported for me,iam not satisfied installation &demo."

I've been using it for almost a week here is my review of motorola revou qled 50 inch tv.

Very very good tv awesome picture quality and sound‚ù§‚ù§
Picture quality is just ok... sound is good
I just loved it. Amazing sound and picture quality.
Sound and picture quality is excellent. Do not compare it with chaines brand and not go for less rating. Sound is crystal clear and enough for domestic use. Overall this TV is very good. One thing is to be noted that screen contrast and sharpness is more better than chaines products and screen life of chaines products are becoming faint after use 4-5 year I feel it in MI TV. Just concept of led bulb that 6 month use its light become lesser than compare new one.Installation part is poor and I...

"One of the best QLED TV at this price range with such a superb specifications.

I also purchased compleat warranty via. Him.This review is just after 48 hrs of installation over all I am happy ,expecting similar services from JEEVES in future too."
Overall performance is good
Gr8 purchase
Good QLED Tv with in budget.
TV is good picture quality is also good. Worth it QLED in this price range. But the only drawback is it does not have ARC or eARC hdmi port for the sound bar to connect. How to connect the soundbar now. My soundbar does not have optical slot. Overall quality and clarity is Good.
Nice
The picture and sound quality is excellent. TV's picture upscale capability is really good. Can use SD set-top box and TV will upscale it really good. Sound quality with 20 watt speaker is really good. You won't need soundbar or additional speakers even for larger rooms.
Simply oswm some bugs company fix please... Another wise excellent tvv.
Picture quality very good

"It is okay product but just after 10 days price reduce by 5K , which is really disgustingIt doesnot seem qled tv, it is normal led tvSound is not ao much effective as mentioned in description, it is just like good for nothing"
I've been using this TV for past two weeks now. Excellent QLED; The display is amazing and produces all colors with utmost clarity. This VA panel does not wash out the colors while viewing from sides. It has good viewing angle. TV when powered on in the morning takes 60 seconds to boot which is normal to any android TV. Once the TV is up everything works quick; Buttery smooth interface but the spotlight remote disconnects often. It reconnects without any hurdles but we often get notificatio...
Superb picture quality and web os software is quite good and much improved. Ultra HD 4k video clarity is awesome and it's quite clear that LG is best in technology. The only area where LG need to improve is sound quality. I can say sound quality is good but not that much great. Anyway a superb TV which is absolutely value for money
received in good condition.Delivery is prompt and the same day service engineer installed. thank you flipkart.
Product is brilliant in terms of Picture and sound. great purchase.Completely satisfied.
"Very good TV. Didn't disappoint at all. I was initially worried about the comparison of Motorola TV vs standard and well proven brands like Sony, Samsung and LG. Because one could see other brands in showrooms and feel the experience. But after going through feedback online and also hearing from a friend who had used Motorola TV I went ahead and purchased this 55"" inch TV. Its sleek yet Audio (Dolby) is very good. No need of Home theatre if you have this TV.  Mainly display is good which is w..."
Picture quality is excellent and many times better than Mi/Sansui and other local brands. Always go for brands like LG/ Samsung /Sony if your pocket allows.Excellent service provided by Flipkart and LG team. Happy with the product.
Product and service excellent
Very Nice Video Quality. Good Sound. Good User interface. But there is Problem in sound with Bluetooth earphones. There is disruption in sound.
It is really a super cool TV.. it feels like premium and value for money üí∞.
Color system super Sound quality super but Remote system is slow light ga
I would not say that the TV is best but if you‚Äôre looking for a budget TV.. go for it. The 4k and HD quality is good and you will enjoy it. Sound is obviously not you can expect to the level of Sony but ok. Connect it from your BT speaker and enjoy. The delivery and installation was super fast. The same was done within 12 hours of my placing the request.
"Top notch picture quality, and sound is really loud with good and heavy bass."
"Earlier I have Samsung 4K 40' but Motorola give me totally different experience, picture & sound quality is superb."

I bought it during sale for my bedroom. I already have a 55 inch samsung 8 series tv so i will compare with it on some points. Cons:1. Remote quality is not good.

Picture quality and sound output are awesome. The included game pad is an added bonus.Few cons that I found and are manageable for me are -1) Takes some time to boot up and load home screen2) Occasionally lags while navigating and playing games3) Audio delay when connected to sound bar via optical (Works fine when TV output is muted)
Nice Product looking for Q Led must bye
Awesome
"Sounds system should give the feel for surround with Dolby Atmos and Vision..but somehow the setup is not fitting with my living room.I feel, I might have to buy a sound system and plug it additionally to get the ambience"
The best QLED TV budget buyers can go blindly. Sound quality is fantastic. Plays 4K HDR10 videos without any stutter.
The picture and sound quality are excellent. FULL PAISA VASUL. Highly recommended

If you want better picture quality then this is not right for you. I don‚Äôt know whether I only observed this is there someone also observed but not given review. The panel of this tv is VA panel which is hidden by LG as well as Flipkart. If you see at 90 degrees then only this tv looks ok. If you deviate little bit 10 degrees away from tv you will lot of white shade entire tv looks so whitish and it is not even comparable by normal Full HD tv‚Äôs. Such a worst product.

Very Nice Video Quality. Good Sound. Good User interface. But there is Problem in sound with Bluetooth earphones. There is disruption in sound.
"Colour production is good , motion interpolation is perfect . It is va panel for 43 inch tv viewing angle is good, not ips as  in description , sound quality is good, Contrast ratio is actually ok  and at times black looks like grey ."
I bought this tv for my brother and this is 2021 model and tv is very good at this price point.
"Top notch picture quality, and sound is really loud with good and heavy bass."
There is difference in opinion about its panel type. Whether it is VA or IPS? LG has not yet revealed about panel type. Viewing angle is not like 178 deg. Magic remote has not been provided thats why we cannot use Alexa and Google voice assistant. You have to purchase magic remote. We can give voice commands through  LG thinq app downloaded in your smart phone but voice recognition is very poor. Compatible magic remote for TV model is not available in India.

TV is quite nice. WebOS is functional. Easy to use. This does not have a magic remote but I don't think we need that as it have LG thinq app which does it better than remote.

Best TV in this price range. I've also purchased 1 Samsung Crystal Pro. Both are great TVs in this price range. Buy the one you're getting for lesser price
Real vallue for money considering the various features and hi end software support like eArc etc within the given price point. What's missing is the magic remote which I believe should have been provided.  No mention by LG about panel type ( IPS or VA ) but over all I'm satisfied with my purchase.

"Magic remote should have been given in the Box Instead of basic remote,  LG should have installed android Instead  of web os , aslo connectivity with my Sony home theatre is not good through ARC, sometimes I need to restart both the home theatre and tv for detection,55 inch has IPS panel and it's best, 43 and 50 inch have VA panel (confirmed from LG service center) got 55inch at unbelievable price 44 k during big billion daysAfter one month of usage I can say display is best ,my opinion is..."

"Display quality is not good as expected. No magic remote, so without Magic remote no use of Alexa. Side viewing angle is not too good. Sound quality is very good."
"Don't think twice. Go for it. It's the best tv in this price range. After one month of usage, I am happy with my decision."
"Pros:- 1. Best value for money if u cannot offer Sony u can blindly go for this.2. Almost equal to natural colurs where as in Samsung it is warm colur.3. Good contrast ratio less then Samsung but still not too worst. 4. Sound is superb for a medium size room.Cons:-1. The panel used is not IPS, compromised viewing angle.2. Without magic remote TV is dumb or kindly install LG application where u can use same magic remote.Overall installation and delivery experience was good"
I like Lg Tv thank you flipkart

Posting Review after 3 months of Use.(not used for gaming)PROS-1. Great picture and sound quality.2. Not that heavy so it's easy to mount on wall.3. Installation process done promptly.CONS- WebOS is not as good as android TV. It is slow too.

Delivery was on timeTV was installed on time but installed on fixed wall mount and we can not move the tv to access various ports which are on the back. We have to unmount the tv every time to access the port which is risky. LG should provide installation on flexible wall mount for TV's which have ports on the back.Software response is slow. It takes about 6-10 seconds even to open settings after pressing the button on remote.Smart TV without a voice command  remote again disappoints. Su...

"If you talk about the TV display quality it surpasses other in it's range i got it for 34k, the audio quite too low as what I personally felt, though I knew about it before I bought it with the expectation I bought it fulfilled it by outstanding measure. The installation service also prompt and comfortable. If you get below 38k go for it, it's the best in the range."

Picture quality is awesome but sound quality is not so good.

"I have looked for various brands and researched extensively before buying this tv. In short, for people looking for other options, this lg tv beats all other brands like hisense, mi, sansui, kodak, vu, blaunkpunkt, motorola, nokia, thomson etc. I have seen some of the tvs above mentioned by naked eye and no one comes close to this. Other brands boast of extensive features, but as they say they are all ""jack of all trades, but master of none"". Trust me, hdr on this tv is better than dolby visi..."

My review is after using 4months 1-sound quality is awesome.2- it has ips display (55inch) viewing angle is great.3- connectivity is also nice.Overall I loved the product.

For watching OTT content the best tv compared to Chinese brands. Netflix even with hd(720p) is great viewing experience. I can watch 4k content on OTT via Wifi connection with out any delay on starting and no buffering at all. For the above mentioned case I have experienced delay in my old mi tv 43inch one.
wow
I got IPS panel in 50 inch everyone in reviews were saying VA panel in 50 inch. Recommended TV
Very good
