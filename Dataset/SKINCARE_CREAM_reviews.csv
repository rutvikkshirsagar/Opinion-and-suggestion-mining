"After using I feel my skin soft and prevent from sun... I did not get tan after using this..., "
"I have been using SevaMed since a couple of months now and 
it is far more better than any facewash I have ever used. It is soft, won't dry out your skin and cleanses aptly. I'd really suggest you to give it a try. Also, a single bar lasts for months ??

Hey dry skin beauties,   start applying this and forget about wasting money on trying other lotions ."
Good for skin
Already used half of it. Gives your skin moisture. It is not that much oily. 
I like this baby oil. My skin is very dry so I use it on my face. It is very gentle and makes my skin hydrated and soft. Must try.

Very nourishing for adults too
Best for makeup removal. Makes skin so gentle and soft.
Tried baby wipes for cleaning up my face for the first time and have to say they are quite gentle and doesn't feel like chemicals. It do cleans and freshens my face but doesn't remove heavy makeup as it is not made for that.
These are perfect skin wipes. Chemical free and gentle. 
Easy to wipe out make up
It helps for the sensitive skin
They are very useful....I love using them...üôÇüôÉüôÉüôÉüòâ
Smells so nice and very good product
"Smells good, I use to remove the makeup. Removes the makeup and makes your skin smooth and fresh "
After using small packet i got big package. It is good for makeup removal.
"Very handy, though for babies but can be used by anyone. I mainly use it while travelling "
Best to remove makeup from ur face..so gentle
"These skincare wipes are the softest to the skin 
Good for sensitive skinssss
The product is a real nice one to use 
I‚Äôd suggest you to buy it. "
It smells amazing and so gentle for everyone's skin. I've bought to make a youtube video on DIY sheet mask.
Quality and quantity both are very convenient
Best for sensitive skin type people... easily removes waterproof makeup 
"The Johnson's baby wipes is very soft and chemical free wipes, it's perfect for baby skin. It's soap free, alcohol free, and is With light fragrance."
"Best makeup wipes ? I removed my makeup all time 
Good one ??"
U can take this wipes anywhere in ur bag helpfull
Smell very good and this is very useful for makeup removal too.
"Very beautiful, extra wet, long, fresh wipes."
It keeps my baby skin so soft and supple 
This product is really good from any other product
Vry nice soap. I used it for my son ... his skin has become better ... must have for small babies
It‚Äôs very mild on babies skin and it will not leave your skin dry at all.
Works exclusively for delicate skin.
Its best soap for babies..will make skin soft n white
Very good for sensitive skin and very Moisturizing
"Soft on baby skin... no strong smell, thus good for those who are sensitive to smell..."
We all just love the soft fragrance of this soap and it's very gentle on skin of my little one
"Sebamed baby never disappoints.. just that the soap no longer comes in a cling wrap that assured better quality. If plastic is to be avoided, then maybe the co can seal the outer carton well ?"
I use it for my baby from the day he was born. Baby friendly. I use it after coconut oil massage with cocolux virgin coconut oil.
Does not lather much but is chemical-free.
Iam really confused about the color of the soap..bz always I bought white color bar..bt this time I got cream color bar
I'm not happy with this soap my baby color going to be dark but it gives smooth skin
It made my baby skin very dry and full of rashes.
It‚Äôs quite expensive for a soap bar but u r actually paying for the quality . 
"I use it for myself since I don't want to skin my dry out during winters. 
It's makes skin really soft and balances pH but it is costly as per my opinion, that's the only concern."
It is  a very good product..so soft..love it
Works good on my baby's skin.
I am using this for my baby.. Just love its creamy texture and smells really good... 
This particular item is what saves the day for the mothers whose breasts have milk discharge. Use these to save yourself from the embarrassment of leakage and to stay hygienic because it's anti-bacterial.
"I'm using this from 2 months after delivery. Now it's almost 1.5 years and still continue using this. First 2  months after delivery I have used cloth type breast pad. But it's very awful and feels wetness and itching and sometimes leakage also. But after using this I didn't feel that I'm using one. It's so comfortable, soft, dry and  free of leakages. Go for it without any doubt ?"
This product is okay for new moms who have the problem of leakage. It absorbs nicely and doesn't feel heavy or wet. Only problem is glue at the back which is very less. I find Luvlap pads are better.
It's a great and very go-to product but I only wish there were some more adhesive since it often comes out because of very little amount of glue at the back.
I used many breast pads but all those have some adhesive so that they stick to my inners. I used every product of chicco for my baby and all are the best for her. This breast pad is a big no for me because of its less adhesive (You can say no adhesive). 
The nipple and skin to breathe and prevents irritation.
These disposable pads are wonderful than the clothes pads which makes u feel wet. The fit is good and doesn‚Äôt tear away easily like other pads.
best nursing pads available in india in a very economical price. these are even very comfortable and lasts during nights. have been using since last six months and will recommend to every new mommy...:)
It really stops the overflow of milk and nipples remain dry.
Its a total savior this products absorb better than rest other brands pads!!
This gave me huge relief. I have delicate breasts and I am liking this a lot.
you will find very less nursing pads available in india. this is one of the best. very useful
"Breast pad from Chicco! would be top notch! right?
 Wrong! though it's absorption power is decent, I didn't like this one bit. First of all, only one side has adhesive and because of which it sometimes slips from its place (even if I'd pressed it firmly in place earlier). Secondly, the pad is way too thick to be comfortable. You are thoroughly aware of its presence. 
"
They are perfect and the best breast pads for lactating mothers soft and breathable they are comfortable and once of you try them you will not choose at other brands.
Nice product. Long lasting. But the adhesive could have been better.
Nice pads but not use it if you have a heavy flow.
"These pads have adhesive only on one side and are not strong to enough to stick. They tend to move around a lot, which is quite irritating and uncomfortable. I have to keep adjusting them to prevent leakage. Expensive product - not worth. Disappointing"
Made with super combed cotton & clastane stretch fabric.
I loved this product really it works.
I use this when I go out and it keeps me dry and confident.
I ordered the pack of 30 pads for trial. It worked perfectly. It's soaking capacity is amazing though I experience heavy leakage. Almost for 24 hours one doesn't have to worry (though changing is recommended after a few hours for hygiene).
So lightweight and easy to apply daily as a serum.
It is good for baby hair as well as elders hair.
It's the best hair oil....my hairfall has reduced to great extent...why looking for any other hair oil when this is at your rescue.
"Jonson baby hair oil is good for kids . It increase hair length ,  little fragnace feel fresh and oil provide silky hairs..."
This oil is very light weight and so mild smell good for baby hair.
"This is the best hair oil not only for kids but for all age group.. Its a non greasy non sticky, works in all season. I have a curly hair & its now soft and shiny after regular use."
Yes this is the only hair oil I have used since my baby was born. It's light on hair and does its work.
I use this oil for my baby and the smell is wow! It's a Light hair oil.
"This hair oil is non-sticky, light weight & everything that a hair oil should be. It's fragrance is mild but heavenly."
Non sticky... Non greesy... Good fr babies
Really great for babies
It bought it for my baby..it smells good.. light weight oil
"I have horrible dandruff issues so applying oils is a big no no for me as it only makes the situation worse. I read somewhere that baby oil can help reduce dandruff so decided to give this a try! I've used it maybe three to four times b4 shampooing and I really see the difference! Although the dandruff comes bck eventually... The overall health of my hair has improved alot! It feels so smooth and soft, almost like a babys hair. Love it!
"
Can be used as serum on damp hair
Love it. I am using this for my 1-month baby.

Who dsnt know about Johnson oil. After taking shower I use my moisturising cream and then this oil . N trust me I smell like baby girl it's so moisturising and put some glow on my body 
I am 23 and I use it as a body oil after shaving in shower and rinse it after a min of massage! It is such a brilliant light weight oil for body ! Won‚Äôt clog your pores at all guaranteed! I have been using for a month now and my strawberry legs have recovered using this oil!

I'm huge fan of this oil. This is soo good.. mild fragrance very effective..
"This is for babies but i also like to using this and this is
Such a good product. "
It removes makeup without irritating the eyes
I use it as my make up remover... As it is affordable and good for skin too... 
I started using neutrogena dry touch sunblock and found it hard to remove with gentle face wash... couldn't find any lightweight oil. So read about using this as an oil cleanser
use it as a body oil works well
"I use this to remove my waterproof mascara , kajal and lipstick , it works well in removing the makeup ??"
The consistency is great. It quickly absorbs into skin
this is actually way better than the makeup wipes available in the market..it doesnt have fragrance and does the job really nicely 
"Gentle product with no harmful chemicals or alcohol as written on the product. Doesn't feel harsh on the skin and effectively removes makeup. If you're putting on super pigmented and very heavy makeup then it probably won't be as good as the proper makeup removers or you might have to use 2 or 3 of these to achieve the best results. However, I would always prefer non alcoholic wipes over the proper makeup removers as those will damage the skin over time. "
"nice wipes , one can use this for cleansing face as well as for adults and babiesn"
the smell of these wipes are so good... and they r very mositurising loved these wipes
I use this to remove makeup and it removes makeup really well. Nourishing. Very good.

Smells very good.. good for baby skin.. using for long time..
I've been using this for more than a year. This product makes me feel like I don't want to change to any other talc from this. You get a lot for this price(sufficient for several months) and it's very affordable.

Definitely a repeat purchase not like other powders this one is very light and goes well on baby skin

This is a very nice powder with a subtle fragrance. A must try.

I ordered this for my new born nd i like it
"Bought it for first tym.Good fragrance, gentle to skin, nice product for babies"
It's not so good but ok product..smells good too.
Very mild baby powder for kids. 
Very worst product not smooth at all don't use on your baby definitely... Just smell is good but again it's very strong whereas.. Baby powder should never smell strong as much as i know.. Please don't waste your many on these powder not worth at all.. Himalaya n Johnson are way more better than this one..
Best for babies it has mild fragrance very light on skin. I also used it for baking... Sometimes replace with compact

This shampoo is very moisturizing and leaves your kid's hair smooth and tangle free. The soothing smell lasts for almost 2 days making the hairs feel fresh. Very gentle and a perfect shampoo for your kids for winters.
"My baby girls favorite one, yes its superb one. "
Very good product for kids and babies. Using this shampoo for my kid since 4 years.  
my friend suggested me for this as this is chemical free and safe for baby
This is the best shampoo for babies !!
this is the second brand of shampoo my baby has been using and I can feel the difference. this is genuinely good product and  now my son also uses other chicco products too.this shampoo is very mild and doesn't harm the baby skin.the fragrance it leaves behind is nice and not overpowering at all.
"This one's a gentle shampoo and also does not lather cause of fewer chemicals, so it's a good thing. But you will end up using more bottles to last a month."
I have tried this on my 1 month old son's hair. I find it nothing great.
Make my hair very dry..  Frizzy....  Not buying it ever.... Itchy scalp....  Dont buy.
This caused severe hair fall for my 3-year-old daughter. I would never recommend this.

Best lotion for babies
Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It smells good and leaves skin smooth afterwards. Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many years now I can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before. This lotion is not greesy at all. 
Very smooth texture and provides deep nourishment to the skin. Smells divine. Can be used both on the body and face. Wonderful product by Himalaya.

"It makes baby fresh and oil free.... with mild fragrance, good for babies??"
I use this powder since my baby is born. I find it best till now.
It's very smooth to apply. I like its fragrance and I will definitely recommend it.
"Packaging is extremely travel friendly for a 50 ml bottle, you can buy bigger sizes too. 
The spray seems exactly like water but the ingredients are really good formula 
Sprays evenly and doesn‚Äôt dispense water suddenly 
leak proof

?"
I ordered the 50ml bottle first that‚Äôs all wastage of money I‚Äôm not saying the the toner is not good I‚Äôm saying the quantity of the product is so less and too expensive so I bought the 300ml bottle received today within 2 days after my order. This is the best toner for acne skin. Highly recommended the 300ml bottle. Besttt besttt avene product. Thanks naykaa for the sale i saved 420 Rs lol. And thanks for the express Delivery 
Gives you glowing skin
 this kinda helped me heal through my allergy process it was really soothing and calmed my inflamed skin this will be useful if you have inflammed sensitive skin go for the bigger bottle since this one is not enough if you're someone who will use it often ps: store it in the fridge and spray it 
"This is such a multi purpose spray. For better absorption, before and after chemical peels! Irritated areas, Just love!!!"
It really calms and soothes the skin and does what it claims. 
This toner is water to skin. It gives hydration as well as does not irritate my skin...best for sensitive skin people..
One of the Must to have for Indian weather. Does not make your skin oily after application. Gives a refreshing feeling after exposure to scorching Sun 
Hydrating
It's just awesome for my sensitive skin..Gonna repurchase it
"Used to buy la Roche posay before this .
But this calms your face . Doesn't have a fragrance which is the best. I use it in the night with the cilcafate repair cream. Works wonders . "
"Maybe I'm tripping but this stuff is so good! 
The first use really amazed me, all of pores srank.
It also reduced my redness, which doesn't go down with water usually .
I wanted to see how the product works so I bought the small size, Now I'll be buying it again in the bigger bottle.
( I use it as a toner before my serums )
Try it
If you have irritated skin."
I am in love with this thermal water this is so versatile you can use it as a toner.odourless good for sensetive skin
It just changed my skin. I always carry it with me. So refreshing! 
Bought it with low expectations after a favourite youtuber recommended it to solve the rash-like bumps on skin(not really pimples). I was pleasantly surprised when it actually worked. I always stock up on this.
"It's really refreshing. One should use it specially after workout, even after laser or any parlor related thing. So that one should feel relaxed."
I've oily acne prone skin. This most helps to soothe and calm my skin down. Keep an eye out for offers as it is expensive. 
"get the bigger bottle if you wanna save money, its better."
Go for the bigger bottles as it's more profitable. 
"Needless to say, i freaking love it!"
Wonderful product. I use it for my baby and never get a chance to complaint.
Himalaya products are better than any other brands. As for the baby's soft skin we should be very careful
After a lots of research on this product. i was looking for the better offer for this product online. So Nykaa provided the best offers and obviously this product is worth to buy.
"Best oil for babies and for us too. Better than any moisturizing lotion that we strive for during winters. You can glide on it before or after the bath and your skin feels lovely. And I must say about the mild fragrance, Its muaah..."
"This oil is love. I have a very dry skin, so it's very helpful and the best part you know what me and my nephew we both use it. He's 2 years it's good for baby skin also."
Its a very nice not super sticky oil for babies...Softens the skin of babies leaving behind a mild soothing smell.
"You can it use it after a bath and it works wonders! It protects the skin and moisturises .can work for whole day long and you may reapply at the night if you still feel the dryness.It smells nice , it's non-sticky yet effective. You will love it."
I am using this oil for my baby.. It is very good for baby skin.. It smells good .. Its also a non-sticky oil.
"its a amazing oil realy good for baby , i am second time purchasing on nykaa with a great discount."
This oil makes baby's skin so soft and protect the skin moisture helps to reduce the dryness.
Himalaya provided me best product for  baby care.It is handy and also easy to use .It gives soft and nourished skin. I love this product. Thank you himalaya.
I purchased it for my 3 years old son . He doesn't want to use any kind of oil for massage except this light body oil . Its really nice with mild fragrance.
Not as good as I was expecting (after going through some good reviews). It's fine. Not bad either
    Using it past 3 months....it's a nice product !!!           
   Really helpful for my skin. It nourishes it completely and suits me. Using it for quite a long time. Thanks.           
"Smell divine, though the moisture doesn't last for long"
Best after bath body oil. I'm a dry skin girl and it makes my skin soft. I use this after bath everyday. I use it under sunscreen or day cream before going out.  it easily get absorbed into the skin giving you that baby smell. It's my 3rd bottle already
Oil is good but very strong smell.
This is an okay oil so light to use not good for winter.
At first I feel good after using this oil. But then it causes pimples on my face and neck.
Its a good moisturiser for dry skin.. might be a little heavy for normal skin.. good for night routine.. wouldnt recommend it for oily skin.. and its fragrance free‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is my second purchase. So much hydrating. I have oily skin, suited my skin well. It has gel based creamy consistency and works good, no need to reapply"
I have very dry nd sensitive skin person.. atoderm baume for winter and the atoderm cream for summer night time... dry skin ladies go for it.. don‚Äôt think twice ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Its a good product which can be used by all skin types. Oily and acne prone skin people can use it during summer night time, in other seasons works well both day and night. 
For dry and sensitive, all seasons both day and night, it will work well.

Its light yet extremely moisturizing... without nasties like parabens
Mild and best
"Works for dry, rough skin, and spreads smoothly"
"My dermatologist reccomended Bioderma Atoderm cream for my extremely dry and sensitive skin. It has no artificial fragrance or any other harmful ingredients, as it can be applied on a baby's skin too. 
It worked really really well. Just apply required amount and your skin will feel moisturised the whole day. It can be used on face or body. For me it worked better as a body moisturiser. Its good for the face too but sometimes it can make your face feel over-moisturised or oily looking."
Sooo hydrating but greasy.. Best for dry skin... 
I love this product...it is little bit runny in consistency than I expected... But works good...I have very dry n sensitive skin and yet it doesn't clog my pours...
Glowwww is to die for my favorite after dermafique
"I have tried many high end, medicated as well as cheap moisturizers such as keihl's, Charlotte Tilbury, Dr Reddy's, Cerave, the body shop oils of life, neutriderm, cetaphil.. etc. Nothing works like this. All you people with extremely dry skin just try this Atoderm creme, you will be amazed by the hydraition it provides and it will completely reduce the acne which is aggravated by dry and irritated skin!! I loved this creme!!"
"Entirely none of the soap suited her..it gives never irritated her while washing my aunt is entirely affected with bugbite somekind of itching with big black spoted wounds in legs...while havin itch,dryness,same time wounds unhealed..everythin pained her but for washing this is her holygrail product she was happy when I bought her..."
Very good soap bar for super sensitive skin..Suits very well itchy n dry skin.
This soap is really kind to dry skin. Hardly any scent though. 
"I‚Äôm never gonna use anything else on my body, this is so good for dry-sensitive skin. Felt a difference in literally my first wash. "
My son and I use this as a face wash and body wash and love it. My skin looks healthier. I have used several expensive face washes before but this is really mild and doesn‚Äôt strip your face off natural oils. My skin is oily and I love this product. I am suing bioderma sunscreen and moisturiser after using this .
If you have dry sensitive skin and normal soaps and body washes strips you then go with this... this doesn‚Äôt strips off your skin and cleanses adequately. Also any skin type can go for it as you don‚Äôt want to go for extra cleansing and stripping your skin off hence leading to irritation in future.
"I just can't explain how happy I am after using this 
At first I was confused but I bought it 
It has really improved my skin complexion and I am using from a month and you can see the difference between my skin 
Every girl suffering from acne problem girl you need to try this once atleast "

I bought this because I was in search for a baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes and I stumbled upon it during a sale and placed my order.

It is a very good moisturizer. Keeps the skin hydrated for long period of time.

I have trued many body lotions on my baby‚Äôs skin and nothing suited in fact they all made my baby‚Äôs skin rough and dry and then i tried this because i apply this on me and i love it. Then i tried on my little‚Äôs skin and it worked as wonders. Super soft and super hydrated and budget-friendly. All expensive products went into the garbage. Sometimes always expensive things are not best.

"I‚Äôm on my third bottle. One small bottle lasts me a month. 
My skin is extremely sensitive to the sun and is acne prone. I cannot use oil based products and anything that has any chance of irritating the skin is out of the question. I have tried some very nice and well reviewed products that work wonders on people I know but breaks out my skin within a day. So, this has proved to be a very good product for me because it doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin. I use it after washing or exfoliating my face. It has replaced the need to use a toner. I also use it after getting my eyebrows done because using anything else breaks out my skin. 
A very simple and gentle product. Worth spending on. "
"This is a bottle full of goodness. My facial skin sometimes become itchy during the winters  and this product helped my skin a lot. I use it as a toner. I've ordered two bottles of it from Nykaa. This is so good. It not only helps your skin to calm and relax, it heals it from within. I'm using it regularly and trust me its worth every penny. I love this thermal spring water so much. Every skin type can use it including sensitive. This has become my favourite in no time. "
Go for bigger bottles travel size lasts 12 days roughly. Its very refreshing for skin u will feel to use more so go for big one.
The product did not break me out. It reduced the redness.
"This mist is so soothing and cooling. I just love this. I need this every day. Perfect for traveling, hydrating, refreshing, cooling and protecting."
I have used 5 bottles so far. I use it 2-3 times daily in summers as it gives refreshing feeling and use it after face wash or after makeup on irritated skin!! This product has multiple uses. 
"Bought it on a whim, really thought it was hyped. But I couldn't be any more wrong. I picked up 2 150 ml bottles, and I'm going to pick up 2 more - ITS. THAT. GOOD.

If you have sensitive skin, get it. you won't regret it."
This works for acne prone skin. Use it as a toner and your good to go.
My everyday product! A great summer product to refresh and wake up your skin every day. I always use this product right after washing my skin and after applying toner to calm my skin down and moisturize and hydrate my skin! A must for every girl!!!!
It really cools the skin and soothes it from any irritation. Good for traveling especially when you feel hot and sticky and when your face becomes really hot. It makes the face feel so fresh and cold. Totally worth it!
"Because I suffer from Lupus, I get very bad lesions and rashes. This product though does not give a permanent solution to them, helps in immediate relief so that I can regain my sanity to then go look for medicines. I have ordered it over 10 times now and this was originally recommended to me by my Dermatologist."
"Calms my sunburnt skin so well. Sometimes, I spray this one on the top of my sunscreen and compact, and they do not move."
The water is extremely soothing and calming and instantly gives a refreshing feeling. It does exactly what it claims.
An extremely good spray. I use it during summers just to refresh my skin in between the day.  I also spray it when I get any rashes or irritation down there. Very mild and gentle on the skin.
I used this on my face after threading and my arms after waxing and it made the redness disappear within minutes! I have extremely sensitive skin and usually have to deal with redness for hours-days. Magic in a bottle!
I just love this product.  First I saw this product being recommended by so many beauty ‚Äúgurus‚Äù on youtube. Its refreshing and non irritant which is big plus for sensitive skin like mine.
I am using this product since 5 years as my dermatologist said thermal sping water spray works wonders post shower. 
I am not really sure of how is it working on my skin yet to see the results 
"Really calms skin down.. loved it. Used it post waxing and it just took away all redness. If you need a soothing and calming spray, this is better. Little expensive but worth it at discounted price"
"I have extremely dry and sensitive skin and have used almost all well known brands, none of them have worked as well as bioderma for my skin.I have been using this product for over three years now. It's absolutely worth the money!"
"I have very sensitive skin and have used Atoderm creme earlier. It calms my skin and prevents flares. Plus, it never broke me out. I use it on my face and body. Thanks to Nykaa for getting me on board."
Good moisture gor dry skin. 
"I only bought this variant since the atoderm intensive baume was out of stock.I have oily skin so I used this at night for my face. Did not have any effect on my acne so it's good in my books. It's wayyy heavier and oilier the the intensive baume one. Dry skin people will love it. I used it for 2 months as a night moisturizer for face and it works great. Too heavy for day time of course. I now use it as a body moisturizer since my favourite is back in stock. Honestly, best body moisturizer I've ever used for my sensitive skin. 100% worth it and will be repurchasing. "
The product is really good but contains paraben.‚òπÔ∏è
"I have hard dry skin like even Farsali didn‚Äôt work on skin, but this lotion has changed my life completely. I am glad I purchased this product. Thank you bio derma."
Keeps the skin youthful n refresh. Best product by far!
"This is a rich moisturizing cream, especially for winter season"
Way too thick for skin to absorb
"Good, but contains mineral oil disappointed."
It's very light and gives a non oily finish 
"Even if it's just mineral oil, your skin will love it for the moisture it gives and the way it retains for a long time. Can be used in multiple ways. I use it after shave and apply whole body before bed"
I use this baby oil as a face oil and body oil to moisturize my dry skin like elbows and knees. It is extremely helpful because i don't like those products which are heavy to my skin that's why i've bought this oil and my choice was right. Go for this product if you are looking for a light oil. 
"The product has a sweet smell , I use it in my undereye region as well. It helps me fulfill my Vitamin E dose for the day and gives a shiny look . 
"
Every month i buy this oil for massage best products 
"I'm using this baby oil for more than 20 years. 
Nice oil to remove makeup, makes skin glow. Recently i noticed it also helps to remove sun tanning.

"
"If you want gentle on your skin, go for baby products. Also, love the fragrance."
"I love the fragrance of the oil, I am still using the same, I swear by it especially for the after-shave nourishment that my skin needs. Plus, it smells amazing. "
"its very gentle on the skin
i use it to remove makeup and its the most helpful while remving waterproof makeup and especially mascara"
                It is very sticky but it is amazing on baby's skin
It has a mild frangrance and very light to skin. Purchased it to use after wax.
My skin has improved alot after I started using it
"This baby oil goes well with everything. It can be used for hair growth, polished nails and even for skin glowing. Using this oil with aloe vera and rose water for skin gives a really good glowing skin."
This is the best oil to massage your little kid. Very light and non sticky texture. Good for sensitive skin.
"Loved it 
Pleasant fragrance and makes skin soft and supple"
I use this for removing my makeup
"Nice packing and good service from Nykaa. 
"
"So, I use it to remove the dirt from my face at night and  I'm telling you this is the best. It also removes waterproof makeup. Just so good."
"It can be used on infants as everybody knows.
But I am a true loyal customer of Johnson's baby products past 27years. And Johnson's baby oil can be used in many ways, viz; makeup remover, body massaging oil, after bath non grease oil for smooth skin, can be used on chapped lips, I just love it.
One product 100 great uses."
"Can be used as body moisturizer, cuticle oil. 
Great smell and totally non-sticky. 
Must-buy for this price. "
"I just love them so soft to my skin I use them to remove my makeup and for a basic purpose, they are travel-friendly but sometimes the glue dries up n doesn‚Äôt seal properly leading to dried wipes overall a nice product."
I have sensitive skin and that's why I don't use any face wash and all so these wipes are a saviour for me and good for makeup removal also.
I use these wipes to remove make up and also cleanse my skin sometimes.
"This is one of the must have things in my bag . Using this for removing my left over makeup , cleansing my skin before the makeup and the list goes on."

"I just love this mist! Very hydrating and refreshing. Love it, so soothing fragrance! So cute packaging and travel friendly. "
"For my combination skin:
Perfectly moisturized skin this water-based spray would give for the winters.
But for the summer and monsoon, this same spray gives me a darker looking face with the water that sits on the skin until it is absorbed/ evaporated."

Nice.. Happy
It's a great stretch marks lotion..it's tummy butter is even better but wasn't available so I ordered this lotion from nykaa. After application no itch in tummy area during pregnancy and helps in preventing stretch marks as well.. for better results one shouldn't scratch on tummy during pregnancy and should apply this regularly. perfect for dry skin of belly during pregnancy.. 
Take time to show but it does work on ur stretch marks
"I'm 50 days pregnant, i have researched and reviewed everything and finally bought this lotion as soon as i conceived. Its good really moisturing my skin. "
I tried many lotions but nothing was working as i have very dry skin. After reading the reviews i bought this one and its result is great. Far better than other brands. 
"I have stretch marks in quite a few areas like recently developed little on my shoulder and leg. My shoulder stretch marks just disappeared and I think am using it, It's been 2 and a half weeks. Effective product. Loved it a lot. "
Within 2 months my stretch marks started fading away. 
"This smells heavenly. Already on my 4th bottle and I am going to buy more for sure. Have been using it for the past 5 months and I can see a considerable difference in how my skin used to feel an look before I started applying this. The marks take time to fade and this helps. It's a slow acting potion so don't be heartbroken if you don't see a difference overnight.

"
Excellent moisturizer. Not at all greasy. Keeps the skin soft and supple for the entire day!‚ù§Ô∏è
"I had some stretch marks over my inner thighs and legs due to frequent weight gain and loss. Trust me, within 1 week of usage it lightened my marks by 50%. This is the best thing ever made for stretch marks. Go for it gals, you wont be disappointed. "
The product has been changed so its smell and all are not the same as before..smells ok only like other moisturizers..but gets absorbed into the skin easily and good enough..not as good as bio oil though
Moisturise the skin well. Trying it from a month. Lets see n wait for the result 
Great- I've been struggling with dry and itchy skin for a couple of months and this has really helped. 
"It is a very good moisturizer,  not sure about how it will help to remove the existing strecth marks.It makes the skin smooth and silky."
Been using it for a week only and can see the diff in skin texture plus the new stretch marks are also fading ...
My skin is very much dry this coco butter fomula gives your skin full moisture effect keeps your skin well hydrated must go for it
"It really worked wonder. I used this from my 3rd month of pregnancy. Trust me, there is no single stretch mark. I am reviewing this product 5 months postpartum."
Magic in bottle . This is my 7th purchase. Absolutely good. And effective. After continue use for 1-2 months you will see effect. And the new stretch marks are gone with in 2 weeks.
It's a really good product if used rightly works well.
"Reduces itchiness, moisturises and prevents stretchmark. Satisfied with the product"
I bought this for 2nd time to my friend she really loves the product she said the product don't reduce the marks if they got before but it will definitely stops in appearing strech marks. So don't think of purchasing this one. have start this when you know that you're conceived. The main thing it's a paraben free no harsh chemicals. And this time I got mama earth face cream for babies (free) Thank you Nykaa.
Its good
I‚Äôm 7 months pregnant and I can‚Äôt see any stretch marks till now. I‚Äôm using this cream for last 3 months and using bio oil for last 5 months. It is really helpful for stretch marks.
Makes skin smooth and soft after applying. But stretch marks didn't disappear.
I used this through my pregnancy and i don't have a single stretch mark. 
Very moisturising and hydrating
Effective but Effects slowly need to be consistent for over a long period
"Religiously usage of this product for a long term shows great results.  Every skin care needs a term of three months to see it‚Äôs effect or difference on our skin, this is a must have for expecting moms and post natal moms. One tube comes a long way too. "
It‚Äôs effective on using everyday 
This is a must-have for all pregnant women. Use it religiously and it will give elasticity to you skin. Use a generous amount daily after shower.
Just completed the first tube and it has done wonders for my stretch marks. I had stretch marks from puberty and also my gynic advised me to use this cream during my pregnancy. It not only lightened the earlier marks but it relieves the persistent itching of abdomen during pregnancy. I will continue use it in my third trimester and postpartum as well.
"I was 4 months into my pregnancy when I first ordered this product. My moto was to prevent stretch marks even before it appears. We all know Palmer's is great when it comes to stretch marks. A little product goes a long way. Texture is extremely thick cream and easy to apply and massage. 
I am happy with the results and have already ordered the second tube. I have attached my almost empty tube that's how freaking nice it is."
My marks has lightened. It takes time but it has
You will really need patience if you want to reduce stretch mark with this cream. I'm using it for more than 6months religiously and finally I can see it is reduced.
I started using this after 2 months of my delivery n now I am completed 4-5 months... it really works I finished 3 tubes n ordered 4th which is about to come..it takes time coz stretch marks are very tough marks to go but if you use it continuously twice in a day you will see the result.
Keep using this product and you will see your marks fading away.
"I have been using it for a little over six weeks, but I didn‚Äôt see much difference in the stretch marks. But it is very moisturising and gives a glow."
This product is very good for those who want to treat their scars  and softer skin. 
Feel like lotion variant is good while applying and stays for long time compared to cream.
I have used this product during my 1st pregnancy from 4th month onwards and trust me I had no strech marks.. and now m using this product again from last 4 months for my 2nd pregnancy.  I loooove this product and highly recommend it. My friends n family were shook that I had no marks watsoever. Even my gynaec(different from 1st) this second time and asked me what I apply. Very moisturising and I suggest you apply after you take shower and its good to go till next day u tk shower.. Congrats if u r pregnant ?
Just started using in my 1st trimester.....sooo hydrating & it really locks the hydration...fragrance is like soo tempting i feel like eating it üòã
"This balm is incredible! 5/5 stars. I used to use Palmer's cocoa butter when I was a teenager in the US; such a wonderful, nostalgic smell. üíïüòç Affordable price, great quality & most importantly - SAFE ingredients! It is now a trusted, staple brand; so happy I could find it in India! üôå The moisture this provides is top notch. My African-American friends in the US first introduced me to this brand & it's what they use for pregnancy(cocoa butter) to prevent stretch marks. Love this stuff & please keep stocking it, Nykaa! üòÇ"
"vanilla fragrance, soft and buttery, perfect for stretch marks"
It lasted me almost my whole pregnancy. It did prevent my stomach from getting stretch marks
"I live the smell, need application atleast twice a day for better result. Thick butter like consistency.  Once pack can easily go for a month or 45days if you apply twice a day.."
"This is so thick and moisturising that putting it once keeps the skin supple for 24 hours. I am highly prone to stretch marks and I‚Äôve read many articles about how if you are genetically predisposed to them, there‚Äôs not much you can do to prevent them. I‚Äôve been using this through my pregnancy and while there have been a few very small light stretch marks it‚Äôs much less than what I expected given my skins natural tendencies. I‚Äôve used bio oil, mums co butter and this one and found this to be by far the best product because of how moisturising it is. Definitely recommend "
"Great product,  If you have stretchmarks and want to get rid of them this is serving you need to try. "
By far one of the best products used that actually works!
"I've used this product in my third trimester, worked really well, very thick, enough to apply once a day.
"
"This is the best stretch mark solution out there. It is natural (free of parabens and mineral oils) and does its work! I got stretch marks in a lot of places due to puberty and nothing worked for me. But I swear, this product does wonders. I'm on my third bottle now and saw drastic results. My stretch marks are barely noticeable now and my skin which has always been as dry as a desert is now super soft like a baby's butt. The best part about this product is that, it works on old stretch marks as well."
Moisturizes the skin and takes time to blur the stretch marks. Smells well.
Using it from a long time no such stretch marks cream give such a good result.
Very good product. I like the product and it is very effective. 
"I have used it throughout my pregnancy and have no stretch marks, the product is extremely good and great value for money"
Been using it for the past two months and I see some lightening. The texture is very thick and rich. Should be especially great during winters.
Within 10days have seen lot f changes. Good to use must buy this product really awesome.
This is my second tub. It is super hydrating and locks moisture for a long period.
"I have been using this product since the last 5 months. I have used it during my pregnancy and it really worked as wonder, not even a single stretch mark till now."
"It really works, might take some time but you will see the results guaranteed."
Removed dead skin layer easily and keep it soft.
"A very effective nonsticky formulation. Helped to condition my nipples and also healing the bruised and sore nipples. I wish someone had told me about this product while I was pregnant, I would suggest expecting moms to start using this 7 months onwards to help condition the nipples to reduce soreness."
"After pregnancy and feeding my baby I used to put this on my affected area and it worked out well and it's completely safe for your baby. Also, for more precautions you can just wipe it off with wet cloth but it's paraben free."
"This cream is a boon to all feeding moms. I started using this recently and all my problems are solved. As I am breath feeding, my skin around the breast started becoming very dry and itchy. I applied oil , lotions and even consulted a doctor, nothing solved my problem. Finally, I tried using this cream and from the very first day, I could see the difference. Now my skin is recovering from the dryness. I would certainly recommend this to all the feeding mother's."
It was a life Savior for me because my skin is very dry and used it on my lips as well
it worked very well for me. ordering the second one for my friend as well
a true  life saviour. apply it post each feed and your life is a bliss.
brought for wife; amazing
It's nice soothing cream and helps to soften.
safe for nursing moms. has helped me deal with dryness and cracked nipples
I bought my nursing butter from here. This contains pure cocoa butter and Pro Vitamin B5. I use this each and every time after breastfeeding.
"very good product,really effect"
"Good for feeding moms. if you are having sore cracking nipples, try this out. Good one."
Agin I brought this up for my friend.. she was facing breast irritation entering to 6th month I order this on nykaa... She was applying twice a day... It gives very good results... Palmer's are paraben free.
It does what  it claims üòÉ...start feeling difference in 1st few applications
"I have been using the cream for around 10 days and there is definite improvement in the texture of the skin. When accompanied by some exercises, desired results can be seen in a month."
It‚Äôs so hydrating creamy and definitely working for me.
"After being a mother, this became so helpful in bringing me back with same confidence with my look."
"Product is very useful, I saw the result after using half tube of cream. Good product for me, so I recommend to all ladies who are facing sagging problem. "
I could already feel the skin around my bust firm after using this for almost 2 weeks. 
"Got this for a friend and it actually works. I'm so glad it helped. Thanks Nykaa and thank you, Palmer."
Excellent in maintaining the moisture. I tried due to extremely dry skin. Love it and can definitely see the difference.
"It really does firms and tone the bust area but once you stopped using it, it goes back to normal. Overall, a good product. "
I have a lot of stretch marks due to my constant weight gain and loss. The formula is very nice and non-sticky. So far I have not seen a lot of drastic difference in removal of stretch marks but I haven't been using this for long. 
it does what it claims.. a much buy .. i could see diffrent in fews days only.. 
I'm really amazed it really works. I could see the result after finishing 60% of the cream. Will buy one more. I'm so happy 
Fragrance is really sweet and the texture is nice too
Firstly ladies you will fall in love with the subtle smell of cocoa and the consistency is so light that it easily glides onto skin making it soft immediately. Will be using it in longer run to see some results.
"My 2nd tube, find a bit different from the 1st tube, not a bad product will work definitely but have to use continuously."
using this from last 15 days. Yet not done anything.
Its moisturising but I didn't see any difference. Won't repurchase.
It firms breast but does not reduce stretch marks
"Useless product, simply wastage of money, no results even after using for a month"
Needful thing
Yes thoug this are baby wipes we can also clear our makeup or makeup brushes with rhis wips.. good quality wipes
Good wipes...useful in makeup removal too
Good one.. Easy to remove makeup.. So soft n gentle 
"it is so good,  moisturizes your skin"
Nic product
Nice 
Nicee
Happy me ..
I use it most of the times when I'm out.. it makes my face look fresh 
Best product...good for skin
soft 
Although its meant for baby's but it suits senstive skin too removes all dirt in single swipe and its way better than kara
"Can be used as a baby wipe, and a perfect makeup remover as well."
"Soft, good fragrance, strong packaging "
I highly recommend this wipe to all for babies and for adults as well. I doesnot feel hard on skin and no chances of dkin rashes. Thumbs up for this product
"20 sheets in this pack.
Good According tp the range"
I always use this wipes. It can wipe out all dust from your skin.
"While these are baby wipes, I use them as makeup removers. Trust me, they remove makeup in literally one swipe, and one wipe is good enough to take off layers of makeup. They also leave the skin feeling moisturized"
People use for baby I use for makeup clean very gentle soft nd supple 
It is silky smooth and worth the money 
Its really amazing .it does what it claims ..will buy it again and again
Best to use in winters. Losing weight is not enough until you didn‚Äôt get rid of you lose skin. Collagen is the best to get rid of cellulite. It does wonders to your skin by tightening it. You should use it every day after a Moisturiser for fast effects.
"This product is amazing, smells lovely, I recently started to use it and I see the difference in my skin already."
"This product is effective in toning skin, just be regular and you will see results"
I just love the fragrance. It gets absorbed easily in skin.
"Thanks, Nykaa to have all genuine cosmetics at single platform. It has all ingredients which one should have in their body lotions. It smells pleasant and very smooth in texture but the plastic bottle is of course lesser quality in this price you can see other companies like Nivea or Vaseline whose plastic is quite better than this at lower cost as compared to plamers. Anyway Q10, and elastin present in this lotion makes your skin really look smooth as they are coenzyme and protein respectively which are essential for skin, and they are anti aging anti wrinkles and anti-inflammatory products and shea butter is also. So according to its ingredient it is a must-buy body lotion for age after 30."
Palmer's Cocoa butter has really lived up to the expectations‚Ä¶ It does give intense moisture to the skin.     
"Moisturizes good not with that greasy feeling which is the best part, smells 4/5,don't know about the firm quality because I've using it for only 4 days but it makes your legs feel so buttery smooth for 7-8 hours."
Using this from last 1 month.My skin has become supple n soft. Must buy
"It is an amazing firming lotion, but it takes some time.  I recommend it but keep in mind you will have to be patient ü•∞"
"I honestly have no idea if it's working in ""firming"" anything.. but as a body lotion it's good and super moisturising without any greasy feel. Hasn't reduced my stretch marks or anything. No significant changes in the texture of my skin, despite regular use."
"This product work, but you will have to be patient with it. Took me time to see results and I absolutely love it!! Highly recommend you guys to buy it. "
"My skin feels smoothness and after 2 or 3 days of using, it's really work, waiting for tighten my skin."
"If you are in doubt, just go for it... It's amazing...!"
after using three months continue morning night I can see just slightly difference in my skin your skin looks so beautiful like your in 20s it works on neck also it gave me firm look for my neck is looking beautiful but we shouldcontinue long for firm Ness I completed 3 bottle and going to order 4 because skin looks beautiful but on breast it works very slowly may be it may take six months to show results on breast my neck area and chest area looking improvement in skin texture that's why I love it
The fragrance is nice but used one whole bottle but didn‚Äôt see any result. 
This is a good lotion. Have been using it for a couple of months. Haven‚Äôt seen much of firming till date. But m not happy with the packaging. It only comes in pump pack and last 40-50ml doesn‚Äôt come out of pump. Which is a waste. Otherwise decent product from palmers
extremely thick texture with extreme fragrance. 
I have a dry skin and I have tried many lotions from different brand but I zeroed down to Palmer‚Äôs. It keeps the skin moisturised for more than 20 hours not to forget the amazing cocoa butter smells which lingers all day! Would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin.
The best for health. Try it without any doubts
I was diagnosed with pcod a few years ago and i never took any medicine. I take shatavari for 3 consecutive months and then take 2 months break and then switch to organic india women's wellness capsule for 3 months. And then leave everything for 3-4 months. It is the best supplements i have ever taken and will continue to take it 
"Although i don't feel a significantly noticeable difference, it's still a good supplement! I have the Shatavari plant at home- it is LADEN with nutrients!! No side effects- go for it, ladies! "
Just go for it. Got periods in a week. Safer than metformin. And is safe for prolonged use. Skin looks at its best too. 
"I‚Äôve taken this for just 3weeks and I can see a difference within these weeks, I recommend this for every women."
"Its good for menopausal problems.
And overall health "
"Can be used for straight one month even when you take twice a day, that will surely show different in next periods."
"Girls, if you have any issues regarding periods. Shatavari to the rescue. Go for it."
its not effects on me.. my periods problm as it as same..
"Basics:
1.First of all check which type of body(vatha,kapha,pitha) is yours according to ayurveda.this suitz for kapha and pitha and not for vatha.
2.if you have history of estrogen cancer or if u have high estrogen levels in your body then dont consume it.
Benefits:
Good skin,
Regular periods
Great for pcos
Increases milk production for lactating women, might increase breast size for some.
Along with ashwagandha can help people who are underweight "
Helps to improve menstruation regularly. also reduced my pms and cramps.
It is so so good for our health..it improves my overall health..highly recommend this...
"This helps in balancing the menstrual cycle. Use it for two continuous months and see great results.   

"
"After a month of using this product my cycles have become regular , whereas earlier my periods even skipped for 2 to 3 months.....really nyc product..."
I have heard so much about Shatavari that it helps in controlling pcod but no difference in me. I daily consumed it until I finished this bottle. 
I‚Äôm taking for fibrosis and has reduced after taking the supplement finished as of now will have to repurchase
"I thought this health supplement would do wonders for me. But, unfortunately as soon as I had my first Intake, I developed an allergic dark patch near my chin area the very next day. I consulted my dermat and got to know I was allergic to one of the ingredients. I would suggest one to take note before you actually start consuming it. This did more harm than good to me."
This product has helped me to maintain my hb levels.
Helps balance every thing.  Does what it says 
Been using for a month now and it‚Äôs showing me results like my hair fall has lessened and my dizziness is alittle better 
I have used it and it helped me with the low blood content.
Got this beauty from nykaa!!! Been a big fan of avene products specifically thermal spray its gives u instant soothing feeling n reduces redness....best thing about this is it is fragrance free if u are looking for something like this go for it!!!! Holy grail of my skin care regime.... i got my 300 ml bottle which is quite large and can last you many months.....
Really soothing but less quantity according to the price 
"Is one of the main reason I love this mist is because it has no nasties, no chemicals, no fragrance and absolutely zero alcohol. In summers I find myself missing this one on my face every few hours because it genuinely hydrates my skin so well. People often say that missed do not work but this one comes my skin so much, I have gone over four bottles already and I will always keep the purchasing this!"
Avene toner is my all time favorite as it is very light weight and feels so amazing in this hot summer. It's just a bit costly that's the only Con it has.
"This is my go refresher, I always finish and start skin care with this . It never dissapoints and give me a plump skin."
Osm for summer 
A must have product. It heals like magic... some of our skin care products and trials gives us breakouts and tiny bumps..trust me this is a magic eraser for those.
love this spray sooo soo refreshing... helps alot during heat of the day
Does wonders to irritated skin. This is my 5th bottle.
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine my skin without thermale spring water. It has literally helped my skin to cope with its hyper reactive nature. It soothes my skin. Overall it‚Äôs a gud feeling.the mist is very fine .  Over a long period of time if u apply it before your moisturiser it does help with hydration levels of skin 
Works great on irritated skin! 
It works well on irritated skin. No bad reviews about this
"If you have sensitive, acne prone skin, have sunburns or irritated skin this is a savior . I just wash my face and pat dry and spray it and let it soak. Worked wonders to my super sensitive skin"
"This is really perfect for oily skin and acne prone skin. I am using this for last 6 months, my acne problem getting cured and skin also feels very fresh. "
It‚Äôs an amazing product mild soft on skin it gave relief from redness on skin even on body. It remove irritation on skin best for summer. Easy to carry while traveling love it
"Close ur eyes & buy it... U will definitely love this product.Makes my skin healthy,Instant refreshing... "
It does amazing job to my irritated n inflamed skin..
It's very good to cool your skin and keeps it hydrated.
"Finally understood why this one is a cult favorite. Does excellent does of exfoloiation without stripping away mousture. Skin feels baby soft afterwords. And the smell is to die for! Though the price is a bit high, but a must buy for a truly spa-like experience at home! "
Its first time I bought mist. Thermal water is quite good for the skin. I really liked this mist with their face wash. But not sure about buying again because of its high price. If you want some mist with this price point then blindly go for this one.. nd I would suggest to try medium size as the smaller one is quite small. I bought medium size only even if it was 1st purchase.
I actually bought this for my tattoo as suggested by an artist for initial 5 days and ended up using it just for the sake of finishing it as i hate to waste products. Wallah..!! Now i'll be using this soap only as it's so smooth and chemical free.. highlu highly reccomend..!!
                Alwaya Johnson baby good for baby
The soap comes with easy grip formula for babies and blossoms is the classic pink soap. The fragrance of the soap is floral and it is gentle on baby's skin. It lathers quite well and easily and makes the skin feel soft and moisturized. One of the classic favourite baby pink soap that I love using on myself too. 
It's a very nice soap. It smells so good and leave the skin smooth and clean. Gentle on skin and affordable.
This is good but after applying it my skin is very drying some time 
Frangance is so charming..but when u will use.. this makes Ur skin dull..
"Ssmells good but it takes tears in eyes my baby and toddler both were crying because it goes in their eyes and thier eyes were burning,  thos soap does not have no more tears formula"
Best soap to use evryday. Very mild. No harmful chemicals 
very gentle on my baby skin
Very awesome fragrance. I like it very much.
"The wonderful smell of this one along with all the good qualities of a baby shop, Sometimes I use this."
"it's tender and delicate, perfect for kids"
"The smell of the soap is hypnotizing.. plus, it moisturizes like any other rich nourishing soap."
It is realy very good soap...so mild it is...smell is awesome...love it
"Its smell is wonderful. Like it. Also, skin become smooth and soft. "
"It has a soft, smooth, lovely mild fragrance, caring to your dry skin needs, well-known brand, pocket-friendly.

What more can one ask for?"
I have very dry skin. I use this soap and it keeps my skin soft and healthy. 
"Have been using it from so long now. The soap has a mild smell, hence I believe it is free from any harsh chemicals. Also. the moisturizing effect of this soap makes it worth a buy. An absolute favorite in this range."
It's the best soap in the market available at this price... makes my skin smooth and it has got a lovely fragrance...
This soap has an awesome fragrance. It cleanses the body without ripping off the moisture from the skin.
"I've dry skin so i was confused with what to buy and what not! It was difficult searching for a good moisturiser. And finally i bought this. Ok, this works superb. It's affordable too! It's moisturising enough for your skin. Dry skin people  try this out!"
I could feel the difference from the first use. Its for dry/normal skin but it suits my combo-oily skin as well. 1)a lil thick and doesn't get absorbed into the skin that much but it acts as a protective moisture barrier so it's best to use at night. 2)very very good for sensitive skin since it's hypoallergenic and fragrance free  3)doesn't clog pores 4) intense moisturising.
It's creamy and hydrating formulation cures dry and dehydrated skin overnight.  I love how it pairs well with my serums and toners. 
"I discovered this cream a few years back and it is great for very dry skin. It does not feel greasy at all. If you have combination and oily skin, don‚Äôt use this but with dry skin, it is a pot of gold."
Lifesaver is what I call for extreme dryness in winters.
Deeply nourishes my dry skin and gives a glossy look.
The cream is scent free and moisturizes well. A good buy for those with dry and sensitive skin. Won‚Äôt break your skin out. 
"This smells like fevicol (literally) but it‚Äôs good for skin during winter not too sticky or chappey , it can be used underneath the makeup so yes it‚Äôs good"
"Not for daytime specially if you are going out... I purchase for my mum I also used quite a bit but it break me out because of it is quite thick and also little bit of sticky.... And for my mum is fine... no comodogenic ingredients ..

Does not provide hydration.. fragrance-free... For eczema is perfect"
"This cr√®me is very hydrating and moisturising, even though I'm oily to combo skin this moisturizer is very nicely formulated, it doesn't make my skin too much oily but if u really dont oily feeling on your skin then this product is not going to suit you, and Normal to dry skin just go ahead to this cr√©me already."
"Since my childhood, i have been struggling with the dry skin. But ya thanks to Bioderma atoderm, i can see improvement in my skin. So ya you all can go for it. üòÑ"
"It‚Äôs hilarious how it feels and smells like fevicol. Like do they share factories with Pidilite? Lmk ? but on a real note, this stuff is thick I‚Äôm texture(like fevicol no joke) and on application it feels hella sticky but it does the job! 600 for a 200ml tube? That too with no nonsense ingredients? Especially post aha bha use where I prefer for the moisturiser to be thick and fragrance free (cause skin is quite vulnerable at that point). Feels tad bit sticky just after using but that goes away after a bit. "
"This is the product that is super hydrating and can make up for days of dehydration. Bt for oily skinned ppl, apply it on clean skin for few hours and then wash it off. "
Good for dry n rough skin.. Worked for me.. 
Very rich and Hydrating.. Calms the skin down.. Don't know if it helps with acne as I have seen no big difference.. But a very good moisture for dry skin.. Affordable amd good quantitiy
It was given by my dermat.  All of a sudden cz of Diy i had fungal acne.  This cream helped my skin calm down. It ll be quite oily in application  for combination  skin but it dries out acne. Did not clog pores.  Soft skin.   Take a pea size amount . 
Its a good fragrance-free emolient based moisturizer.. But feels bit heavy n greasy for summer times on my combination oily skin.. A pea sized amount is enough.. Non-irritating. And doesn't sensitize.. Would be great for people with eczema or dry skin.. My eczema prone hands really like it.. 
"It works well on my atopic skin. I use it frequently throughout the day. Suitable for dry to extremely dry skin, not normal or oily. "
I have tried a lot of moisturizers nothing worked. Cetaphil was horrible. I have combination acne prone skin and this one worked pretty good. You wake up with glowy moisturized skin in the morning.
It's for dry skin. I use it as a body lotion. A little bit sticky though. 
I'm using after long time...very light weight formula..
I use it as a makeup remover and to clean my brushes
I have used as makeup Remover. It's working nicely
"I absolutely love this one .
I use after shaving my legs it's moisturizing"
Its superb... U can use as makeup removee.  U can masseg it on face
"Best oil to remove makeup ‚ú®
It smells good and also u can massage with this oil though it has vitaminE ü•∞"
Mix couple of drops with any body lotion and lather yourself up. Give you baby soft skin and no itchiness.
"I have to say this nykaa is the best online site to buy authentic products with safe packaging ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I loved their packaging very much , for that only I'm giving  5 stars"
"So smooth on skin, very hydrating"
Nice product.... can be used as moisturiser or as a makeup remover..... gentle to skin..... works perfectly for dry skin‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanku Nykaa you sent me gift for my birthday 
Used it on face and body and it really smoothens and softens the skin after a few uses. Especially if used after a scrub. I used the McCaffeine coffee scrub and then this in place of a moisturizer with amazing results.
I use this oil on my face. Really moisturises well. 
I was using bio oil which is no doubt a great product but i noticed that it takes time to absorb into the skin. Now how do i know about Johnson baby oil? I got my first tattoo and the artist recommended using baby oil for after care. I was surprised to see how nicely this oil is absorbed into the skin without being oily. It makes skin very soft to touch and keeps hydrated all day long. Also it is perfect for summer. 
Johnson's  Baby Oil is such a multi purpose product. Its so usable for the adults. I use the oil to clean my make up. And with this oil my eye make up is wiped in a single swipe without rubbing the skin.
"I ordered alot of skincare products from this app and let me tell you, it's 100% genuine and amazing "
"A multipurpose oil. Can be used on hair as serum for frizzy hair, skin as moisturizer its very light. Can also be used as make up remover. Mine is oily skin and acne prone haven't caused any breakouts. "
"Good body moisturiser
Can be used as oil cleanser (as mineral oil is non comedogenic) do follow with a regular cleanser
In my opinion a multipurpose product"
I'm using this oil as a makeup remover. It's really smooth. Nice productüëçüëå
I used ut to remove makeup and also for shaving works really well.
"Nice wipe, cleans all the face, especially use for makeup removal."
The wipes are big enough and relaxing to use and also gentle.
Awesome.... It's make skin so soft delicate.... Fresh... Go for it.
I use them as makeup removing wipes which is kinda safe and best method without any harms to the skin.
Johnson's baby wipes are just right for all age groups as its sensitive skin friendly as well.
Safe and travel friendly wet wipes. It suits on all skin type.
It is the Best wipes for skin care for Removal of Excess Makeup 
To remove waterproof makeup need to use two sheets of it. For regular makeup one sheet is more than enough. 
These wipes do wonders. Leaves baby like soft skin.
I'm very fond on wipes and these are my favorite!
Ideal for removing makeup. 
"These are the best wipes used till far, gentle on face and very mild."
I use it as a makeup remover and does the job perfectly. 
Best till date. I have come across from so many wipes but this makes me crazy. Can't think without it. So soft and gentle on skin and gives fresh feeling.
"Awesome product, thank you Nykaa who suggest us to buy such a good and healthy wipes with no chemicals. Loved it."
Its very gentle on the skin. I use it to wipe out my makeup before rinsing it with face wash.
"I got this to wipe my nephew clean but then I also used a few wipes to wash off the makeup of my face when a face wash wasn't available. These wipes do a really good job! People judge me for using baby products but hey, when I can get cute baby products without much chemicals that harm my skin, why should I even bother."
"I personally use this product to remove makeup off my face, which it does remove perfectly. 
The only disadvantage is that if it is not used in the same direction as the weave on the wipe, it'll be rough on the skin. Other than that, it is a great product.           "
Very soft and clean wipes for everyone.
My friend suggested me to buy this wipes and it's amazing.
I would prefer the tummy butter over this due to the consistency. This one is a bit sticky. 
It works great. 
Superb moisturizer. Effective on stretch marks also. Working slowly.
I've had stretch marks since I can remember. Using this cream twice a day for 3 months made them lighter than they've ever been. I use it only at night if it is very hot because sweating makes it sticky and patchy on my skin. Even application just once a day helps.
"Have recently started using it, yet to see the results."
The very nice product it works great on stretch marks.
Amazing product and assured reduction of stretch marks.
This is the best stretch marks product I have ever used I love this lotion it's like a magic
This cream is life.... used this throughout my pregnancy with another oil and trust me on this one... NO STRETCH MARKS
I have repeatedly used this product and find it very helpful for stretch marks. Would definitelyrecommend it.
I don't know if this works on stretch marks because they are hard to remove and reduce as they are situated in the dermis. But the fragrance of this is soooo intoxicating. You will feel like you're spreading white melted chocolate on your body. It is so difficult not to get tempted to taste.
Well packed and received within 3 days after placing the order.  Thank you Nykaa.
Nice product worked well after and before my delivery.
I have used this product since my first trimester.i have used at nights in the beginning and then used twice a day with days passing. there are no traces of stretch marks on my skin as I was twin pregnant..
"Great product.
It's really effective.
Also, hydrates your skin."
I had itchy skin around the tummy during pregnancy. I am using it regularly and definitely feel super moisturized. it smells great and I haven't got any stretch marks as of now. I'm 6 months pregnant.
I used it for my whole body .... as a daily lotion....  and it works even on very old stretch marks and scars.....  and soothes my skin.....  moisturizes for the whole day....  the only drawback I would say is that... it stinks a bit and is a very rich and heavy cream....  could be used for the winter season but not as an all-weather daily lotion...  as I personally sweat a lot...
The product works very fast and you will see the effect after applying 1 bottle .It is extremely hydrating too!!
It‚Äôs 9 months after delivery. I am using this from last 15 days my stretch marks are almost gone. Unbelievable it faded so fast. Thanks palmers
very effective cream.... in pregnancy.. moisturizes well and keeps stretch marks in the bay.
Good
I don't like the fragrance..not the usual Johnson's standard
Can be used to remove makeup
"I must say Johnson never disappoint me.
These wipes are the first time tried Johnson wipes and they are not harsh on skin and gentle 
will like to buy a bigger pack once I finish this"
It is the same as usual wipes but little better than others.
Easy way for makeup remove smells good.
Dried out very soon.now it's like a tissue paper I have 
I usually get the bigger packet of wipes but this one is cute and travel friendly. The wipes are enough moist to clean the skin.
Guys provide Good discounts on such products..... Overall it a nice product with fewer chemicals 
"The area near my eyes and cheeks itch and burn but somehow they work well. Also, I need to use like 3 wipes because 1 doesn't suffice for an entire wipeout of my makeup."
"I use this to remove my makeup and it cleans 80% of it up. The packing says its ""lightly fragranced"" but I feel the smell is kinda strong. "
It removes make up well but it leaves irritation on my skin.....if you have a super sensitive skin like me think before buy.....will not repurchase it....
After opening the wipes get dried too fastly.  
I have been using this as wipe for my face to remove makeup since wipes were not even a thing. but lately this has started giving me burning sensation on my face. I have discontinued its use.
"I purchased this thinking baby wipes would be gentle on the skin but it burns when I used it on my face and I have normal dry skin, not sensitive."
I used these as makeup removing wipes. Thought these would be gentle on my skin but instead made my skin feeling irritated.
It is good to remove makeup. But it also irritates on my skin as well.
The tissues doesnt stay wet for long. Gets dry fast
"The tissue is almost dry, kindly replace it immediately. "
Multiple uses perfect for makeup remover for baby dust remover
"i have combination skin but i do need hydration without letting my skin being oily, this one fulfills that requirement! it provides the right amount of hydration and also im a matte makeup lover and at times my skin does look lifeless but again this product comes to the rescue and works amazingly as makeup setting spray making my makeup look very natural! since its multipurpose, i will get over with it very quickly and its surely expensive but its a must have product!"
It is a multi-purpose product and a must have for sensitive skin people.
"So all the reviews are not at all hyped. This holy water is all I ever wanted for my super sensitve skin. Go for this one ,have already placed an order for 2 more bottles. Thank you Nykaa for making avene accessible to us. Kudos"
Literally become my favourite toner..no fragrance no color tasteless it feels like water buttttt it's not ... it's  like a magic bottle ... make ur skin pimple free hydrating without any stickiness. .. little expensive but it worth single penny. .if you have dry combination oliy skin go for it boys nd girls .. me nd my brother using it ...he have hormonal acne with oily skin..i have dry  skin.. nd suits both of us ??
It‚Äôs pricey for a refreshing mist. There‚Äôs a lot more better ones in this range! It gives you a refreshing glow and that is it. Doesn‚Äôt do wonders. It‚Äôs decent. 
It could be a bit expensive but its a really good product. Go for the bigger sizes as it'll be worth it
It is an average product. I had high expectations from avene. 
It does works but I would rather buy the avene cicalfate cream. I starting to prefer the cream more than the face mist. But it really feels refreshing on skin.
Nothing great about it and nothing bad. It is just a spring water mist. The packaging is solid and it is easy to carry. 
This one works for hyper sensitive skin and helps to keep it soothing. 
"This + Avene Mat Mattifying Emulsion has helped me control sebum explosion. I have extremely oily, and acne prone skin. While it did not completely stop the oil, it does leave my skin fresh and oil free for good 2-3 hours. You can try the 50 ml pack, but it won't last long - if you are doing the day and night regime."
"I don't know what to say , after reading so much good reviews I purchased 2 of it and disappointed ..... 
Started noticing small bumps on my cheek after second day of use and my face becomes oily within 15mins ..... May be it doesn't suit indian skin with combination types.., I think it's just for refreshing your face I mean a really expensive refresher .better use rose water for skin problems ."
"Feels like regular water, nothing special about this."
I have been using this for 6 days. But it is not an amazing product in this huge price.
I did not find any extraordinary result with this product. It didn't do any harm but i think it's not a must have. 
Very good product for skin must use by everyone.
If you really wish to start using face mist! This is the best choice. It is very refreshing and doesn't cause any acne as it is meant for sensitive skin. You can switch to strong ingredient face mist once you get used to this.!
"I was really excited when this came in the mail. i got it in the summer and sprayed myself everytime i could because i was addicted to how it cooled and freshened my face. unfortunately all that spraying meant it got over in a little over a week :( i loved this and i was very pleased with what my skin felt like after. so minus one point for how little of the stuff i got but overall, even with the minus one, it is a wonderful product"
"Sure it does hydrate your face, but not more than ordinary rose water less than half of it's price. It doesn't calm down acne / pimples either. "
Literally I have seen no difference . instead of changing or sharing my pimples or redness I can observe that I have some small bumps like the comedons. I think it can help your skin natural balance.
"A soothing cream designed to keep the baby's skin happy. Have used it for both my children. The price might pinch the pocket, but very little is required and helps rapidly."

"In love with this baby oil, it gives you very smooth and soft skin.
You can use this as a moisturizer for your face. "
"Since I work as a beauty blogger I already have to spend so much of my money on products, and facial oils are extremely expensive. So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil warm up in my hands and just tap it on my face.So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil, warm up in my hands and just dab it on my face. This makes the make up to melt on my skin so beautifully and also that Makeup stays for long. I don‚Äôt use any other serum or facial oil, all I do is use this and it works literally the best for me. 
You can see how beautiful it looks when I apply the oil before my makeup. Also this is so in expensive, literally the best"

Removes makeup like a dream 
Hey it is easy to use and good for babies skin... In winter when baby is not taking a bath I used it as a dry cleaning for cleaning baby body and it gives freshness and good smell...  And my secret is I also use it as a makeup remover... It works great....
Tried them for the first time and damn! They make the job so easy !
Really good wet wipes .very gentle and soft
Its so moist and moisturizing. Very good for using on babies. Rash - free and nice fragrance. The best wipes not only for baby but also for adults looking for wet wipes. 
"these are my absolute favourite now, gonna stock them up"
I used this wipes from last 2years its a best wipes for your skin 
These are not only for babies. My face feels so fresh after using these
I am satisfy with the product..It is best product for skin
Best wet wipes till date for babies .... and for all of us also
They are soft and have light smell. I use this as face wipes and after traveling a lot it removes all the dirt. Love it
It makes my skin smooth and cleans the dirt away from my skin quite well. I loved it. 
While it is for baby. But i use it as make up remover and freshen up my skin. Lovely
"This is budget friendly, and I also used it for wiping my face, I love it."
I'm using this product to remove my makeup for a couple of years now. I couldn't find any other make up removal wipe as good as this one. This is very gentle on my skin. Removes my waterproof mascara like magic with one swipe. This is very moist. 
"Very good quality to be trusted, love Nykaa's products."
It is not only used for babies. It can also be used for makeup remover wipes  for soft and glowing skin.
"Though it is a baby wipe I use it as my makeup remover and trust me it is way better than any makeup remover wipes I used till date. Soft on skin, removes even my kajal. Nice Fragrance. "
We are talking about  Jhonsons & Jhonsons and what can go wrong in that.!! Buy it guys!
This wipes are awesome..I used it as a makeup remover... N also clean ur face dirt very well...it's my must have product...
 Excellent product started using the product 2 weeks ago and can already see the results.
This product will deeply nourish your skin.. Stretch marks need time to lighten up but yes I think it will work.
It don‚Äôt know my scars fade away or not but I tell u this product is very much better for dry skin I use it in hand also
It has a thick consistency which needs to be massaged well in the areas of concern. Not sure whether I will repurchase it since my skin is on the oilier side. But it will perform well as body lotion for very dry skin. Lightens stretch marks to an extend with continuous usage.
Good product and smells too good 
I'm giving this product as 4 rating star...its been more than 3 weeks since im using this product but I'm barely able to see any difference on my stretch marks...it may have lightened the stretch marks but not enough to differentiate...
Loved it. It really helps to reduce the stretch marks and makes the skin firm and smooth silky.This my 2nd purchase and I hope it will give more excellent results.
Good product for my dry-skinned pals
"It is definitely an extremely moisturizing lotion. I had dry heels and ankles and I applied it everyday to my feet after a bath. They softened up very quickly. Although I can't testify the claim of reducing stretch marks, it definitely faded some old injury marks I had on my feet. A little pricey but not a bad deal at all."
"I've finally found a lotion that works for me, and doesn't require frequent applications during the day. Best to use during winter months, skin feels supple and nourished. Haven't seen any effects on the stretch marks after using for two months, so I'm not sure it works. But cannot be used during the summer for normal skin type. Might work for dry skin beauties. "
"This was recommended by my mother as it is what she used when she was expecting and she doesn‚Äôt have a single stretch mark. The lotion is more effective in preventing stretch marks than in fading existing ones. Stretch marks occur when there is a tear in the fibers in the skin when it expands. It is also genetic, meaning if your mother had a lot of stretch marks when pregnant, chances are high than you will too. Stretch marks may fade with time but never completely go away with any topical creams. However, research shows that 1. Massage and 2. Moisturizing help in preventing the appearance of stretch marks.
I started using this product in my third month of pregnancy and have no marks on my tummy. I used it diligently twice a day, once in the morning post a shower and once at bedtime, by massaging it into the skin. I noticed that when applied once, the lotion keeps the skin moisturized for the entire day, even when your clothes rub against your skin all day. As your pregnancy progresses, the skin on your tummy becomes very itchy, red, dry and sensitive. This lotion takes care of all these issues. Highly recommended."
"I use it on my butt for the stretch marks after a shower, they have lightened and my butt has become significantly smoother."
It  really works on stretch marks 
I don't like the smell but it is working 
Bought moms co sterch mark oil and cream first but could not even touch it due to overpowering scent. But palmers lotion has only a very very faint fragrance. Good for pregnant women with smell sensitivity. Pump packaging very convenient to use. Not sure if it will completely remove strech marks but overall great moisturizer
It‚Äôs very hydrating. I was very confused between other brands and this for stretch marks. Buh I think I made a right choice. It‚Äôs very hydrating and thick. Love it 
I am using this product everyday from 1month  i didn‚Äôt find any difference in my stretch marks till now..but hope for the best
This product is kinda sticky and is probably for winters but does wonders to my stretch marks!! This is my 2nd bottle and I‚Äôm loving it!!!
Iam 7 months pregnant now..using from this month..it is oily..fragrance is good..awaiting to see results 
Used during my pregnancy. Strech mark was minimal. 
"This really nourish my tissue. Using this for 3month, I can say it's very effective. After bath apply it with circular upward motion till completely absorbed wait for 5mins then wear sports bra. "
Been using it since 2 weeks. No visible results. But the smell of the product is very nice. Like coffee. Hoping to see results after more applications 
Am not sure if its working. My 2nd bottle though. Am giving it a try just to confirm if it works 
Very nice oil. I have been using after delivering my baby for almost 3 months now... really good. 
My breast size is perfect but it's very loose I don't want to heavy breast and can I use on my face also.
Worth Buying it. Great result!                                                                                  
This is my favourite site for cosmetic n beauty products shopping. It avails me huge discounts. I love doing shopping at NYKAA! :D
"Good product, smell is lovely, affordable and gives quick results."
"Used it for about 3-4 months and should say the results are worth, skin becomes real tight combined with good diet and exercise, it will really give great results must try to repair sagging or loose skin."
"firstly, oil is not magic, it takes time to remove all the cellulite, be patient it will go away. regular application of this oil helps in increasing blood circulation  and reduce fat.
"
I have been using it from last few days.it will be too early to review but yes there is a change.i am using it with massage cream and i can see difference
"The product is nice, still using it, will review after few days "
I like this because it is too good for mature skin to make skin brighter and uplift.
"Love to use this product. Going ahead to use it, again and again, thanks Votre!                         "
Bought this product a long ago but it helped me a lot through... Worth buying this
Like this product as it gives tightening with the help of natural products.. thanks VOTRE.. BRAND TO BE TRUSTED!!
Gave good result to me. A must buy again. 
i like this product a lot. helped me in firming and shaping naturally. thanks .
"Thanks Votre brand...After using this combo u can see the positive difference.It's give firming, tightening and shaping and also gives hydration with natural products."
i had been using this for long back now. but now i can say that its worth it.. satisfied.
"Love to use this product going ahead to used it, again and again, thanks Votre 

Worth Buy it great result!
"
Its helps tighten but not uplifting breast
"I have been using this  since last 8 months but no result seen till now. Completely worthless.
"
Using since last 5 month but no result seen till now..worthless
"I have requested a fast delivery due to I‚Äôm travelling on 25th July I ordered on 22nd July amd NYKAA kudos to your team I got my parcel in 48 hrs thank you so much and the product is well packed so so happy to shop with NYKAA and biotique is my all time favourite brand there is othe option for me to replace this brand 
Thaaaaank you so much lots of love üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò"
Gentle on eyes and pet friendly as well
My baby love to pour it in the bath tub.
Omg. So fruity fragrance and silky body feel. Get the baby soft skin again with Biotique Bio Berry Mommy and baby body wash.
Simple joy of bubble bath for kids ‚ù§Ô∏è
My kiddo (1.5 year) loves the bubbles ! Smells fine..not too strong. Apt for kids 
"It lathers very well,the scent is just amazing."
This is an excellent product.. it's my third purchase.. lathers very well and suits my baby' s sensitive skin
Yes very little amount creates many bubbles...bubble lovers go for it
My baby is very happy in playing with the bubble
This baby bath has really nice fragrance 
Its a decent affordable bodywash with pleasant smell and foams just perfect. you don't need gallons of water to wash it off unlike other bodywashes. Recommended.
"I use this company products for my babies n they are amazing plus it's herbal, but particularly this one has very unique n pleasent smell which Simpy makes your little once bath time happy. Go for it."
Smells refreshing. Good for daily purpose. Safe for both mom and the kid.
"A few drops creates a lot of foam and bubbles. Can be used by people of all age and all skin type. Tear free, good smell and fun to use. Special recommendation for kids. "
Go for it concerned mothers. It will not disappoint. The smell is soothing. 
Kids in the house started loving it the day they were introduced to this new product in the family. It is a usual thing that kids products are kept fragrance-free for reasons that are known to all but this particular product and its rich aroma with a mild cleansing action is just being loved by the kids at home. Awesome it is.
"It's a great product for tub bath, pleasant fragrance, mild. Overall, a great product!"
"This product, I am using it for face wash. Works well for my sensitive acne prone skin. I have been using it for 3 years."
It doesn't create very to very much bubble.
It has improved the size and has no side effect at all. It is a good medicine  so anyone can use it to get better. 
"Just bought the cream. Started using it.Hoping for the best. Fingers crossed ? Also I have a question. How long does it take to increase the breast?? So that, I should be prepared mentally. "
Seriously it works with in 2 weeks. Awesome Product
Natural product smells good & I think it will really work.
Nice product.Good packaging..
It's been a month or so since I'm using this product.I see a changes but not much.I kinda liked it though. Planning to order one more.I hope it does wondersü§ûüèº
On regular massage with this can help it look firm and it can grow up to one size.
It‚Äôs have effective result but take a more time.
"The Enlargement Cream was good, but the results are getting too late."
It does what it says. Have been using this product for a month now and can see changes already. Discreet packing. Thank you Nykaa. 
"i bought this product for my sister and it really works.
*apply this after taking shower with warm water.it opens the clog pores and helps the cream absorb better.
*eat food high in estrogen , do exercises and use this product for better results."
It didn't work for me. it doesn't help to increase your breast size. So don't waste your money on this product either go for natural things like pure oil that might work.
I have been using it for 1month till now I have seen no difference. Let's see after some days.hoping for the best‚Ä¶
I just started using this product.I think I have some patience to see result.
"It's about 10 days but This product doesn't work to me till now even though I use it twice in a day, hope it will work soon."
"I use six months no result and no improvement
"
"Waste of your money don‚Äôt go for it. I used for about 3 months and no freaking change at all.. even I saw some rashes around my breast area.. please dont waste time , money and patience on such products "
"Please do not try this product, it is not worth it, it didn't do any effect on me, it was a waste of money once again please do not use it."
It is realy  a superb product..just awesome quality..lov eit
This seems to be really working on me. But the quantity of product is less and the product tents to get in the form of vapour when the lid is kept open for at least more than 5 minutes
Needful thing
Yes thoug this are baby wipes we can also clear our makeup or makeup brushes with rhis wips.. good quality wipes
Good wipes...useful in makeup removal too
Good one.. Easy to remove makeup.. So soft n gentle 
"it is so good,  moisturizes your skin"
Nic product

Nicee
Happy me ..
I use it most of the times when I'm out.. it makes my face look fresh 
Best product...good for skin

Although its meant for baby's but it suits senstive skin too removes all dirt in single swipe and its way better than kara
"Can be used as a baby wipe, and a perfect makeup remover as well."
"Soft, good fragrance, strong packaging "
I highly recommend this wipe to all for babies and for adults as well. I doesnot feel hard on skin and no chances of dkin rashes. Thumbs up for this product
"20 sheets in this pack.

I always use this wipes. It can wipe out all dust from your skin.
"While these are baby wipes, I use them as makeup removers. Trust me, they remove makeup in literally one swipe, and one wipe is good enough to take off layers of makeup. They also leave the skin feeling moisturized"
People use for baby I use for makeup clean very gentle soft nd supple 
I ordered it again. It's not too expensive. It works.
I have been using this order one more of the product works well 
Fully happy n satisfied with results...needs patients n regularity..highly recommending..
I don‚Äôt know what it is about it but it works overnight. It's not a permanent kind thing but works only with consistent use. 
That product is Awesome. I have been using it and the Results turned out to be Awesome
"Am using it for past one  month , infact most of the night I forgot to use. while I was supposed to use it twice a day but I can't even mange 1 time some times in this case you guys can't believe I am so much satisfied with the product, it really firms and tighten your breast. my brest got lifted up alot. I will definitely recommend this product who has issues with Breat make it your best friend."
"According to other creams i felt that this is good for my skin it does not harm the breast, it is amazing."
"A very good product I must say m using it has been 1 week only I can see  the changes. I am very happy with this product waiting for more changes, quantity is also fair much. And I am thankful to NYKAA that they are selling this product which so much of discount, and they are genuine. I love Nykaa. WE TRUST NYKAA."
This is the best breast firming cream has ever used and can feel the difference in 8-10 days after applying it. but only thing u need to apply it daily without Missing.
Amazing smell and can be easily applied 
"An honest review, true to myself. I can see my saggy got little firm. This cream will take time to reduce saggy. But persistent usage will lead us to see the results."
This product is really effective. I noticed a slight tightening within the first day of usage.  Awesome product. 
A superb product could see the result within a few days. Thank you Nykaa.
Does work with firming and sagging with regular use 2 times a day !! But takes time so be patient. 
I have used this product for more than a month.. and this cream really worked for me.. i used one tub and it really started working.. u can see the change slowly n gradually as u keep on using.. but this cream actually works.. u can go for this cream but u need to have patience as it shows the results slowly.. this is my honest review... thank u nyka..
I have no idea if it works or not but doesn't have any side affects as of yet and I've finished about a bottle of it.
Definitely working but not sure about breast contour... need time to observe that...
I had dry skin around my breast. This cream deeply moisturizes it. Didn't see any difference regarding the firmness of the breast.
It works not magically but some improvement is guaranteed
"I used it for 2month regularly but i found no result...after using only i m giving review...
"
I daily use this product and there are visible results 
"It is vix or jhandu balm type in texture 
Heavy greasy product but it absorbed quickly "
Does what it claims!Thanks VLCC and Nykaa:)
"Useful product
Very much effective"
"It's been using of 2 weeks. Really it is working for me to reduce Tommy fat. Best results to get this if you 
just  apply & do exercise. "
religious use to and see the results....
"I am using this product for the first time and I am glad I did tried it....
The gel is non-sticky and does not have a strong smell ! 
You feel good while massaging it and it does get absorbed quickly....
I am experiencing tightening of skin without any skin allergy !
It can do it's job alone.... but with some exercise and green tea it performs amazingly ! 
It is effective and on top of that it's cheap.... !"
"it works, but gradually witb the help of exercise, u can also apply it and wrap your stomach with cling film and workout, it make u sweat alot and burn alot more fat"
Got the original one from nykaa
"I""ll definitely try this again..such a awesome product and unbelievable result, 5 star from my side"
Works best before working out. Makes you sweat a lot faster and relaxes your muscles.
Very nice cream gel for tightening skin
Use it before workout. It do gives good results.
"Its feel very good on skin, also it is very nourishing on your body, loosing some inches in weeks."
"very useful product for loose tummy fat,but if you want its work so you can use this on regular basis with some exercise.very effective when use with gym.."
This is the 2nd piece I'm buying and found a difference of 2 inches probably. Use it regularly to notice the change and massage it well.
Have been using .. it helps sweating more and target the area
With regular use n exercise dis product actually shows its work. i'm giving 5 star for this. 
With mild exercise and the regular application gives good results.
Great result. I m using it last three month. I saw a lot of differences.
Very smooth and soft skin after using this. Also suitable for 25 age people having sensitive skin
Excelent product.. Very nice.. Liked it.. 
Very moisturising
Best for babies
It's really good for baby skin
Good moisturiser for babies in winters 
I don‚Äôt think so it‚Äôs good for oily skin ..but best best for dry skin people 
"Very good product for babies,fragrance so nic and easily absorb on babies skin,thnku nykka"
I have a sensitive skin so i prefer using baby cream for my face... And biotique is one of the company which does justice... This cream smells so good... And is thick cream and it moisturizers your skin n keeps it soft... Got 2 of these in a combo pack.. and will recommend for people with sensitive skin.. doesn't matter which age group..‚ô•Ô∏èüëç
It is definitely very moisturising and gives a healthy glow.. But not best for summers and oily skin.. Fragrance is great.. My skin felt smooth and nice
Good
Boutique is one of the brands that r quiet affordable and nice..
It is very hydrating ..best baby moisture cream for dry skin...
Very very very nice product thnkuu nykaa??
"Biotique is my all time favorite........ 
Thank you nykaa for this offer... And that so many products I need........ Love you nykaa app.... "
"Very nice cream..
Not greasy at all..
Loving it.."
This is my 5th time...withiut any hesitation go for it guys ?
Not at all oily after applying skin absorbs .makes the skin soft and smooth. 
The reason I chose this moisturizer besides many baby moisturizers in the market is that the ingredient list showed only natural products except the cream base. It is a basic moisturizer for babies with zero harmful chemicals and it keeps your baby skin hydrated well enough.
My daughter skin is dry.... It really works on her face... Now her skin is so soft n shiny... Little bit oily but her skin is dry it's suits on her face even her summer... But is is  highly recommended for winter... Must try... My truly review ... I was using himalaya products ... But biotique is first one.... Amazing experience... O have become a fan of biotique 
Best cream
Its a perfect sunscreen i have ever used. Please use it and see the magic....
Whenever I apply the sunscreen it gives me a refreshing touch and even works as an face cream .. thanks nykaa
Really good for kids...nice fragrance...
"really nice, not only for babies really good for 20 to 28 years people. "
Very nice and makes skin very soft and very nice smell..I am very happy to buy this
"Protects very well from tanning, best for baby's skin. 
"
Spreads easily don't leave a sticky layer on your baby's skin which is great. Be sure to reapply though.
Biotique is natural products.nice for baby skin.this sunscreen is just like moistureing cream.my kids like it's texure.
"I purchased is for my kid but it's perfect for me and my husband also, I am big fan of biotique company"
Its just wow..i received the parcel..and when i apply this to my baby girl..soon her skin improved.. thanks nykaa nad biotic
As described  very light and non-greasy sunscreen for sensitive skin 
It is good for the babies. Use it before going outside. 
"This makes baby's skin soft, very shiny and providing full day moisturizing."
"Best sunscreen ever purchased its come in handy where u can carry if ur travelling out and it keep ur little one cream hydrated and proacts from harmfull rays
"
"It was for badies and I accidentally got it . MAHN ,IT SMELLS HEAVENLY . IT IS AMAZING ??????????"
Good for kids..soft texture.. Safe
Biotique products is very genuine and I loved it
Smells good. It's useful for school going kids. It protects from tan.
"Nice mild fragrance cream, light texture and good for your baby."
Got this beauty from nykaa!!! Been a big fan of avene products specifically thermal spray its gives u instant soothing feeling n reduces redness....best thing about this is it is fragrance free if u are looking for something like this go for it!!!! Holy grail of my skin care regime.... i got my 300 ml bottle which is quite large and can last you many months.....
Really soothing but less quantity according to the price 
"Is one of the main reason I love this mist is because it has no nasties, no chemicals, no fragrance and absolutely zero alcohol. In summers I find myself missing this one on my face every few hours because it genuinely hydrates my skin so well. People often say that missed do not work but this one comes my skin so much, I have gone over four bottles already and I will always keep the purchasing this!"
Avene toner is my all time favorite as it is very light weight and feels so amazing in this hot summer. It's just a bit costly that's the only Con it has.
"This is my go refresher, I always finish and start skin care with this . It never dissapoints and give me a plump skin."
Osm for summer 
A must have product. It heals like magic... some of our skin care products and trials gives us breakouts and tiny bumps..trust me this is a magic eraser for those.
love this spray sooo soo refreshing... helps alot during heat of the day
Does wonders to irritated skin. This is my 5th bottle.
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine my skin without thermale spring water. It has literally helped my skin to cope with its hyper reactive nature. It soothes my skin. Overall it‚Äôs a gud feeling.the mist is very fine .  Over a long period of time if u apply it before your moisturiser it does help with hydration levels of skin 
Works great on irritated skin! 
It works well on irritated skin. No bad reviews about this
"If you have sensitive, acne prone skin, have sunburns or irritated skin this is a savior . I just wash my face and pat dry and spray it and let it soak. Worked wonders to my super sensitive skin"
"This is really perfect for oily skin and acne prone skin. I am using this for last 6 months, my acne problem getting cured and skin also feels very fresh. "
It‚Äôs an amazing product mild soft on skin it gave relief from redness on skin even on body. It remove irritation on skin best for summer. Easy to carry while traveling love it
"Close ur eyes & buy it... U will definitely love this product.Makes my skin healthy,Instant refreshing... "
It does amazing job to my irritated n inflamed skin..
It's very good to cool your skin and keeps it hydrated.
"Finally understood why this one is a cult favorite. Does excellent does of exfoloiation without stripping away mousture. Skin feels baby soft afterwords. And the smell is to die for! Though the price is a bit high, but a must buy for a truly spa-like experience at home! "
Its first time I bought mist. Thermal water is quite good for the skin. I really liked this mist with their face wash. But not sure about buying again because of its high price. If you want some mist with this price point then blindly go for this one.. nd I would suggest to try medium size as the smaller one is quite small. I bought medium size only even if it was 1st purchase.
Good in quality and very useful saftey pins.
"Very poor quality and these are very small in size. Also super flimsy, they'll bend if you use a bit of pressure. Won't recommend. Save your money for better ones."
The pins are of local quality and are packed in the name of vega.
"I've purchased it for 2800+
And the next day it is sold for 2300+ range I'm disappointed by that 

Otherwise excellent product and excellent quality

Long lasting too... "
Again a light day wear. Very refreshing.
"The fragrance is very good. Had purchased as a gift for someone, who liked it very much."
"The fragrance is very good. Had purchased as a gift for someone, who liked it very much."
Soo great 
Love love love massaging this oil on my skin. Light weight and good for dry skin. 
I love this for everyday use in the summer especially 
So cute oil and awesome smell
This has been my most trusted oil when it comes to my baby. For hair or body massage i have always used same oil
Who dsnt know about Johnson oil. After taking shower I use my moisturising cream and then this oil . N trust me I smell like baby girl it's so moisturising and put some glow on my body 
I am 23 and I use it as a body oil after shaving in shower and rinse it after a min of massage! It is such a brilliant light weight oil for body ! Won‚Äôt clog your pores at all guaranteed! I have been using for a month now and my strawberry legs have recovered using this oil!
"i use it as a makeup remover nd it does the job beautifully
"
"I usually use it for my body massage. It is amazing.
"
Good for skin I am applying it on my face tooo
Very affordable and amazing oil to remove makeup
This is amazing u can use this as a makeup remover also
Nice smell and has vitamin E which is very good for hair silly and shinny hairs
I'm huge fan of this oil. This is soo good.. mild fragrance very effective..
"This is for babies but i also like to using this and this is
Such a good product. "
It removes makeup without irritating the eyes
I use it as my make up remover... As it is affordable and good for skin too... 
I started using neutrogena dry touch sunblock and found it hard to remove with gentle face wash... couldn't find any lightweight oil. So read about using this as an oil cleanser
use it as a body oil works well
"I use this to remove my waterproof mascara , kajal and lipstick , it works well in removing the makeup ??"
The consistency is great. It quickly absorbs into skin
this is actually way better than the makeup wipes available in the market..it doesnt have fragrance and does the job really nicely 
"Gentle product with no harmful chemicals or alcohol as written on the product. Doesn't feel harsh on the skin and effectively removes makeup. If you're putting on super pigmented and very heavy makeup then it probably won't be as good as the proper makeup removers or you might have to use 2 or 3 of these to achieve the best results. However, I would always prefer non alcoholic wipes over the proper makeup removers as those will damage the skin over time. "
"nice wipes , one can use this for cleansing face as well as for adults and babiesn"
the smell of these wipes are so good... and they r very mositurising loved these wipes
I use this to remove makeup and it removes makeup really well. Nourishing. Very good.
Perfect for removing makeup. Just 1 wipe and its done. 
It's a best wipes...it's remove all dirts and impurities.
No strong smell.. budget friendly ..not harsh on skin.. no fear of more chemical on face .. 
It's so soft and nice
Wipes that may suit everyone super refreshing
I have been using this from so long & it‚Äôs a must have in your bag whenever you wanna feel refreshed just wipe the dirt off!
Best for aldutls with sensitive skin
I use this everytime I couldn‚Äôt wash my face. Nice product. Didn‚Äôt cause my breakouts.
Very soft and easy to use. Skin friendly tooo
It is so soft on your skin. I use it as makeup remover and i like it.
This wipe is amazing for removing your makeup go for it guys!!! 
Using it for my granny and uts very useful and soft
Useful while travelling I always prefer these wipes over any other brand
Love it. Has been over 5 years since my daughter and this has been the best
Purchased this again. And always in my wishlist. Best to remove light make up and to go freshen up
"As a face moisturiser it is a good one but for tummy during pregnancy, it has to be applied twice or thrice a day for its the effect"
Very good lotion but will have to use it regularly to see the results.
It takes time but it has reduced my stretch marks due to weight gain.
I like this product and cocoa products from Palmer's. Too early to comment on its effect on stretch marks. But definitely feels good and pleasant...
I've started using this product lately. Its smell is really very soothing. It keeps my skin smooth and supple for long hours. Hoping for the best results.
Great option to avoid pregnancy stretch marks . 
"I have been using it nonstop since i got stretch marks after gaining weight, it is so moisturising n it removes stretch marks to a great extent by regular use"
"This brand‚Äôs butter is the best when it comes to keeping skin moist in pregnancy, this lotion is also good but you need to keep reapplying it after every 3/4 hrs. Fragrance could have been better though."
Skin feels itchy after few hrs. Not very moisturing. I feels oils are better than lotions.
This product makes your skin really soft but doesn't do much for stretch marks. And it smells good too.
Not seeing any difference in stretch marks till now but from hydration point of view it is good. Fragrance is also mild. 
As a moisturizer it is good but don‚Äôt see any difference in stretch marks. May be because I‚Äôm not a regular user.
"I don't know if this thing has started working on my skin. Last time I used it, I saw a huge difference. But now I'm not a very regular in using so maybe that's why."
I am currently on my second bottle. It does moisturize the skin but after 6-7 hours need to reapply it.
I ran out of this pretty quick. I didn‚Äôt really see any difference in my stretch marks but it worked well as a good body moisturizer. Maybe I need to use it more often to work on my stretch marks. 
Using this from past 3 months yet havent seen any changes onto my stretch marks  but it does helps in moisturising the skin so 3 stars for the hydration.
"√ëon sticky, quickly absorbed. Skin feels smooth. Good for summer but during winter and if you are dry skin beauty it won't be sufficient. More hydration is needed. I bought this for my pregnancy let's see if it works for stretch marks"
"I have only been using it for a few days now so I don‚Äôt know how well it works on stretch marks but it‚Äôs definitely a very good moisturiser. Not very greasy. The fragrance is not exactly pleasant, but it‚Äôs mild. "
It‚Äôs a very good moisturiser but I didn‚Äôt get good results with respect to stretch marks
"It's has chocolaty fragrance, one can use it as a moisturizer but I will not recommend this product for old strech marks."
"I just love them so soft to my skin I use them to remove my makeup and for a basic purpose, they are travel-friendly but sometimes the glue dries up n doesn‚Äôt seal properly leading to dried wipes overall a nice product."
I have sensitive skin and that's why I don't use any face wash and all so these wipes are a saviour for me and good for makeup removal also.
I use these wipes to remove make up and also cleanse my skin sometimes.
"This is one of the must have things in my bag . Using this for removing my left over makeup , cleansing my skin before the makeup and the list goes on."
I use this product to remove my makeup on some lazy days. Also use it when I was in road during summer!!! It gives a refreshing and soothing effect!!!
really helpful for wipe out face...dontmake face dry....good product. ..........really happy to use this wipes.
This is what I use instead of wet wipes and it ensures that I don't have dry hands. The not so floral fragrance also ensures the men in your life will not be scared to ask you for one
it is very hygienic and very satisfied for money...superb product
I use it to remove heavy face and eye makeup and it works great..I have even used it as moisture wipe in air conditioned environment..It passes with full credit here also..
 I use it almost 6years and it just gives my skin a baby like nourishment.      
"You can use as your makeup remover, nice wipes."
These are very soft wipes .. i use them as my makeup removing wipes .. it doesn‚Äôt irritates at all .. love this product the quality and quantity is very good .. its worth every penny ! I just add some miceller water and it wipes everything.. loved it ?
Good product 
I am using these wipes from very  long time even on my clients. They worked really well. It is very gentle on skin and even removed makeup but not waterproof mascara.They are in budget too.
Great quality and fragrance 
It will work for every skin type. Cleanses and hydrates at the same time
i m using whenever i came from outside and it cleans all dirt from face.. also use as makeup remover wipes 
This is the only wet wipes I prefer. This is so soft I tell you. Non harsh and doesn't irritate the skin further.
"Not very effective in removing make up though. However, isn't that very bad. Does a decent job."
Good moisturizing wipes. Does not makes skin dry.
"                Though its a baby product but i use this to moisturise my face and it works brilliantly... Its good for people who have dry skin, my skin is oily but during winters some areas of my face become dry so it needs good moisturizing.... The texture is not that greasy, easy to blend and has a decent smell....
"
Very good moisturizer. I bought for my son but now i also use this.. Sometm it feels greasy.. But overall good.. A must buy product. 
The cream is very thick with a mild scent. I use it as a hand cream as it is too oily for my face. It is very hydrating and the best part is it is ayurvedic and does not contain harmful chemicals.
its too moisturizing and is a bit greasy....good during winters.
"Bought this for the first time. Though the ingredients are promising, my concern was the quantity in the sealed tube. It was almost half. Why the need to cheat like this? "
No full list of ingredients is mentioned...also it's smell is like balm...not worth it...I would definitely prefer Johnson baby products for my baby
"I bought this cream for myself to use as a face moisturizer in winter since in colder, drier weather, my skin needed some extra hydration. This cream is pretty emollient in nature. After application, it feels slightly oily which takes a while to absorb/subside. So if you have dry skin that tends to get even drier and flaky in winter, this might be a great cream. If however, you have oily skin as I do, it's better suited to apply at night so that your skin has the entire night to absorb the product or just use it as a body cream. A tad bit heavy for use on the face."
This cream is good for babies having dry skin.... Daily cream is necessary
"Though its a baby cream but it works for adults too, it is good for people with dry skin but greasy for normal and oily skin. "
Not long lasting but has moist properties and statement fragrance.
This is a very soft daily use kind of cream for babies. gets absorbed easily and provides nourishment for 2 hours.
but under eye if applied had watery eyes little itchy or else oky on face no side effect as such
Greasy on the skin makes my skin more oily.
"I found it to be a heavy cream for a baby cream with a almond-ish smell. For that reason, have been only used it on my daughter's arms and legs and not the face. "
Nice and effective product by biotiue. Thanks nykaa for on time delivery and delivery agent is also very supportive.
Veey useful moisturizer for baby
"I m oily senstive acne prone skin type 
It suits me well
I m using as a toner
"
Calms down the skin if u have any irritation and best for sensitive skin. I use it when i have sunburns or irritating skin . But pricy . 
"Idk if it does much!  But can be used when skin is extremely sensitive, since its just water anyway "
"Guys, its one of the best products ever..I use it to calm my semsitive skin since my skin feels so irritated,itching and becomed red at times..but the only con is its quite expensive and since i am a teen thats the only problem but otheriwise i would keep buying this product

Happy purchase!"
This is my 4th bottle and first Avene purchase from Nykaa .. I don't know whether it works for me or for everyone but I hardly know any person who has got any side effects or reactions after using this... Very soothing calming not only for facial skin but can be applied on any irritation all over the body
"1st of all dis is my most repurchased skin care product of all times. I started taking care of my skin around 4 years back and from then the money I have burnt on cosmetic üôÑ don't ask me... I have extremely sensitive combination skin which has a mood of its own sometimes it's dry sometimes it's oily, easily gets clogged pores... Now this was my 3rd or  4th face spray I purchased after a few from kama Ayurveda n forest essentials and few other well known brands... This s a holy grail I can't get enough I use it jus aftr my morning n night cleanse as... Also if my Skin feels a lil dry during day I jus spray it all over... My mom gets bad irritation if anything bites her and she uses dis a few times and dis calms her skin down. It's a product which has multiple uses and also is non irritating for most sensitive skin... My only problem is, it is a little pricey for the quantity  I always buy it when it's on offer. "
Smooth on skin. Helpful in rosacea
"It is very refreshing. Makes skin calm n bright. I will definitely purchase it again. 
Thanks nykaa!!"
"One star less because of the nozzle, This time the nozzle spit crazy ... like LOL, It's hard to use when it feels so harsh spitting water. hahaha .. Other than it's my HG, It calms my skin after morning wash, night wash, day freshen up, Massage aftercare,  Peels After effect, It almost my one has to be there product. 
My redness has calm down and my skin looks ready to be moisturised,  toned and makeup after this wonderful application of spring water. "
"This product just calms your skin! When my skin dries out or feels itchy, I use this and it just soothes my skin "
Good for sensitive and dry skin It keeps ur skin smooth and helps from skin irritation
"People with sensitive skin can close their eyes and purchase this. I apply this thermal water before makeup and after makeup, as this makes skin super soft but can‚Äôt use it on regular bases as it does not help with pore problem. I have combination skin with acne."
This does help in controlling face inflammation. Imparts a healthy glow which is short-lived by the way. Great as a make-up setting spray.
Love this face mist. Heard about this a lot from vloggers finally I bought it. It's good for sensitive and irritation free. Will buy again.
"Doesn't irritate your skin at all.. very gentle mist , great for oily sensitive acne prone skin!! "
"Great for summers, but is high on price point."
Keep your skin hydrated by using it before moisturisation.A good product .
It heals the skin so well.It reduced the inflammation and pain on my acne.I dont regret buying this at all
My dermatologist recommended my to spray this thermal spring water anytime of the day whenever my sensitive face becomes red. Very good for sensitive skin type. Highly recommended 
Nice mist works wonderfully on my skin I like this product worth buy feels refresh 
This is my holy grail men's fragrance for summers
beautiful perfume with strong undertones. loved it
"
Simply loved the Fragrance.. Original product. grt quality.. Every guy should definitely try this one out.."
"Good for daily use. However, it is not long-lasting."
My husband likes it as a daily perfume. Smells good and lasts all day in air con.
A decent fragrance. Lingers for quite a long time. 
My 2nd purchase from Nykaa and again got a good deal money wise. Product has a strong fragrance and last for a good amount of time 4 hours approx. Overall good. 
Loved it. Lasts up to 4 to 5 hours.
I got this for my husband. Perfect men perfume. Definitely should try it!
It has a very nice smell and lasts longer throughout the day.
As the brand claims that it is EDT which means that the scent lasts longer...well it is actually a very good option for those who want a classy scented perfume in a good range
"This is one of those perfumes which you can never get bored of. Its simple, it's fresh and it's long lasting. It's nothing over the top notes but quite basic and that's why it's appealing. "
Natural summer scent lasting to 4 to 5 hours
Love the scent...easily lasting for 4-5hours...best one...
I like the fragrance but won‚Äôt stay for so long.
It's a wow product from Nautica really.
I bought this perfume for my husband and he loved the fragrance.
the fragrance easily stays for about 4-5 hours. worth the price.
loved the fragrance
"This perfume has one of my finest frangrances, very suttle yet long lasting"
Good for skin in winters
"This is a must skin care product
Moisturizer+highlighter+face serum+gooooooodnessss....."
"In love with this baby oil, it gives you very smooth and soft skin.
You can use this as a moisturizer for your face. "
"Since I work as a beauty blogger I already have to spend so much of my money on products, and facial oils are extremely expensive. So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil warm up in my hands and just tap it on my face.So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil, warm up in my hands and just dab it on my face. This makes the make up to melt on my skin so beautifully and also that Makeup stays for long. I don‚Äôt use any other serum or facial oil, all I do is use this and it works literally the best for me. 
You can see how beautiful it looks when I apply the oil before my makeup. Also this is so in expensive, literally the best"

Removes makeup like a dream 
Hey it is easy to use and good for babies skin... In winter when baby is not taking a bath I used it as a dry cleaning for cleaning baby body and it gives freshness and good smell...  And my secret is I also use it as a makeup remover... It works great....
Tried them for the first time and damn! They make the job so easy !
Really good wet wipes .very gentle and soft
Its so moist and moisturizing. Very good for using on babies. Rash - free and nice fragrance. The best wipes not only for baby but also for adults looking for wet wipes. 
"these are my absolute favourite now, gonna stock them up"
I used this wipes from last 2years its a best wipes for your skin 
These are not only for babies. My face feels so fresh after using these
I am satisfy with the product..It is best product for skin
Best wet wipes till date for babies .... and for all of us also
They are soft and have light smell. I use this as face wipes and after traveling a lot it removes all the dirt. Love it
It makes my skin smooth and cleans the dirt away from my skin quite well. I loved it. 
While it is for baby. But i use it as make up remover and freshen up my skin. Lovely
"This is budget friendly, and I also used it for wiping my face, I love it."
I'm using this product to remove my makeup for a couple of years now. I couldn't find any other make up removal wipe as good as this one. This is very gentle on my skin. Removes my waterproof mascara like magic with one swipe. This is very moist. 
"Very good quality to be trusted, love Nykaa's products."
It is not only used for babies. It can also be used for makeup remover wipes  for soft and glowing skin.
"Though it is a baby wipe I use it as my makeup remover and trust me it is way better than any makeup remover wipes I used till date. Soft on skin, removes even my kajal. Nice Fragrance. "
We are talking about  Jhonsons & Jhonsons and what can go wrong in that.!! Buy it guys!
This wipes are awesome..I used it as a makeup remover... N also clean ur face dirt very well...it's my must have product...
 Excellent product started using the product 2 weeks ago and can already see the results.
This product will deeply nourish your skin.. Stretch marks need time to lighten up but yes I think it will work.
It don‚Äôt know my scars fade away or not but I tell u this product is very much better for dry skin I use it in hand also
It has a thick consistency which needs to be massaged well in the areas of concern. Not sure whether I will repurchase it since my skin is on the oilier side. But it will perform well as body lotion for very dry skin. Lightens stretch marks to an extend with continuous usage.
Good product and smells too good 
I'm giving this product as 4 rating star...its been more than 3 weeks since im using this product but I'm barely able to see any difference on my stretch marks...it may have lightened the stretch marks but not enough to differentiate...
Loved it. It really helps to reduce the stretch marks and makes the skin firm and smooth silky.This my 2nd purchase and I hope it will give more excellent results.
Good product for my dry-skinned pals
"It is definitely an extremely moisturizing lotion. I had dry heels and ankles and I applied it everyday to my feet after a bath. They softened up very quickly. Although I can't testify the claim of reducing stretch marks, it definitely faded some old injury marks I had on my feet. A little pricey but not a bad deal at all."
"I've finally found a lotion that works for me, and doesn't require frequent applications during the day. Best to use during winter months, skin feels supple and nourished. Haven't seen any effects on the stretch marks after using for two months, so I'm not sure it works. But cannot be used during the summer for normal skin type. Might work for dry skin beauties. "
"This was recommended by my mother as it is what she used when she was expecting and she doesn‚Äôt have a single stretch mark. The lotion is more effective in preventing stretch marks than in fading existing ones. Stretch marks occur when there is a tear in the fibers in the skin when it expands. It is also genetic, meaning if your mother had a lot of stretch marks when pregnant, chances are high than you will too. Stretch marks may fade with time but never completely go away with any topical creams. However, research shows that 1. Massage and 2. Moisturizing help in preventing the appearance of stretch marks.
I started using this product in my third month of pregnancy and have no marks on my tummy. I used it diligently twice a day, once in the morning post a shower and once at bedtime, by massaging it into the skin. I noticed that when applied once, the lotion keeps the skin moisturized for the entire day, even when your clothes rub against your skin all day. As your pregnancy progresses, the skin on your tummy becomes very itchy, red, dry and sensitive. This lotion takes care of all these issues. Highly recommended."
"I use it on my butt for the stretch marks after a shower, they have lightened and my butt has become significantly smoother."
It  really works on stretch marks 
I don't like the smell but it is working 
Bought moms co sterch mark oil and cream first but could not even touch it due to overpowering scent. But palmers lotion has only a very very faint fragrance. Good for pregnant women with smell sensitivity. Pump packaging very convenient to use. Not sure if it will completely remove strech marks but overall great moisturizer
It‚Äôs very hydrating. I was very confused between other brands and this for stretch marks. Buh I think I made a right choice. It‚Äôs very hydrating and thick. Love it 
I am using this product everyday from 1month  i didn‚Äôt find any difference in my stretch marks till now..but hope for the best
This product is kinda sticky and is probably for winters but does wonders to my stretch marks!! This is my 2nd bottle and I‚Äôm loving it!!!
Iam 7 months pregnant now..using from this month..it is oily..fragrance is good..awaiting to see results 
Used during my pregnancy. Strech mark was minimal. 
It‚Äôs v nice for day wear and v mild fragrance 
The fragrance doesn't last for even an hour. Very disappointing performance. 
"One of my favorite perfumes, long lasting, can be worn in summer or winter, buy one for you and you won't regret."
"It smells very rich, deep and citrussy. Though it is meant for men ,i find it even smells amazing on women too. Its a unisex fragrance. "
"One of my favorite perfumes, long lasting, can be worn in summer or winter, buy one for you and you won't regret."
"One of my favorite perfumes, long lasting, can be worn in summer or winter, buy one for you and you won't regret."
"Bought this product from Nykaa for my dad and he really loved it. It is so worth the price. The top notes of lemon, lime, cinnamon and base note of smells magical. If you like such notes this the fragrance for you."
"This perfume really smells all day and night long, I‚Äôve gifted this to my friend. And he is very much happy with this gift, you can also use because the smell is really amazing, can be used by both. It can be used for office and parties as well."
Not at worth it ... very light perfume not at all stay waste of money.
Nivea is my all time favourite.....this time i ordered nivea fresh deo for my husband....its fragrance is awesome......you'll definitely feel fresh after using this deo......love nivea.....love nykaa
It gives long lasting refreshing fragrance and fresh feeling. It definitely does a good job as a deodorant. However it doesn't cause any kind of skin irritation.
"Loved this deo..
It has a mild and refreshing smell.."
Long lasting mild fragrance. Ordered it for my husband and he loved it
Perfect for men....Love the smell...I love the lock system
"I bought this for my elder brother & he loved it
Fragrance is soooooooo refreshing and long lasting ?

üòù
Amazing 
Smell Is To Good 
as usual we got genuine product
"It is best for men, long lasting and smell is beautiful. "
Wow 2nd time order
"Does what it says. It is a great deodorant, with not a very strong smell but still keeps you feeling refreshed for a long time. The doe's scent is faintly alluring and is not overpowering at all.
The bottle is sleek and fits easily in the bag, not really expensive, nice smelling, lasts long 
I purchased it for my brother "
It's a men's deodorant but I love putting it since I was in college. It keeps you fresh and odourless throughout the day.
I bought it after reading the positive reviews and now I am happy that my husband likes it very much. He uses it at daily basis.
Very affordable and very fresh smell. Good for summer
It has a very refreshing smell. Just 2-3 sprays are enough for the entire day.
"Smells good.
Long lasting."
Nivea deos  are  always good. Soothing fragrance and gentle for skin.
"Bought this for my husband, it has a nice sporty fragrance even I use it sometimes while going for the gym. It lasts long too."
Lasts for long. Doesn‚Äôt give patches on clothes. Its a every occasion deodorant 
"amazing fragrance...i love this...Bought this for my husband, it has a nice sporty fragrance even I use it sometimes while going for the gym. It lasts long too."

"Not a fan of men fragrance, but the men love this."
"Very good , one of the best deos i ever used in this price range.Really fresh frangrance , if u want sweet scent not for u ,go for other variants."
Good product and excellent service of Nykaa. ...
Its a good deodorant for every day use. It has a very good fragrance which lingers all day long. Good to buy.
I love the icy sensation of this product as it really does wake me up and prepare me for a long day at work outdoors in the sun. It prevents excessive sweating and a little amount of this product goes a long way. 
gifted to my boyfriend & he is just pleased with my choice
Refreshing. Smells good. No cooling effect such. 
I had ordered this one for my dad. Nivea is the best be it for body lotions or deodorants. I love them all. And this one is a strong deodorant has a nice fragrance. Staying power is really good.
I consider this one of the best deos for men! The fragrance is so unique and fresh! the deo is friendly with the skin as well! The can is slim and very portable. i definitely suggest this to guys who sweat a lot. 
But it sprays like  white powder 
I gifted to my husband.He really liked it.
"Wonderful fragrance
Long lasting
Cap lock unlock is an added advantage for traveling"
It's a good deo. I love Nivea deos. They do the job best. Fragrance doesn't stay because its just a deo. But it doesn't make you sweaty or sticky and specially keeps odor at bay even after heavy gym sessions or long working hours and travelling.
"Products are there in good offers, nice price and everyone should buy delivery was fast."
My husband already used this one regularly! Bonus was the discount we got on nykaa and shipping charges that I saved on my shampoo!!! 
Whenever I have gifted it to someone I have always receive positive feedback. 
The deo is very Long lasting and has a great smell. Perfect to use before hitting the gym or going for a run. I use it almost every day. This is my 5th bottle in the past year!!
"A very fresh and long-lasting fragrances, especially during summers, which is really good! Gifted this to my brother and he loves it."
Nice deo.... refreshing and gentle to skin
"It's good refreshing, Lasts for 4-5 hour in summers."
I trust the nivea product and it's worth it product. I like the product.
"It is one of the worst deo

I can only see white gas coming and showing smear on all my shirts

I am a big fan of nivea products. Nivea products are always on my go-to list. I bought this shower gel for my brother. Pay off is good and it's very hydrating gel.
‚úå
Have always loved men's body wash üòÇ it's just amazing‚ù§Ô∏è
"I think for the price, the product is a must buy. My husband appreciated the product. It‚Äôs a refreshing aroma."
Nice smell. Lathers less but is very refreshing.
Very refreshing body wash. Great fragrance & texture.
"Nice fragrance which stays full day, best Nivea product for men."
Value for money. The scent is strong. Good for men. Good for regular use too.
This shower gel is highly effective and refreshing. It isn't necessarily only for men.
I bought it for my dad. It smells amazing and very refreshing. After shower it doesn't dry out your skin. Must have for the summer season. Love it. 
It can even be used by women. For freshness in the summers.
"When I use first I feel like I was swim in a deep calmed ocean. In simple I enjoy bathing with this shower gel. I also, like its bottle shape. Thanks, Nykaa."
It's awesome it gives cool senation first use and loved it thou it's of men but I liked it Soo much I wanted something for summers and it's perfect 
" It does what it says , no nonsense there .. 
Makes u smell fresh all day .. 
Doesnt overly strip the oils from ur skin and IT DOES give you that COOL KICK . I must say its a keeper .. go for it !! 
"
I brought this for my husband. This is the 5th order I placed for him for this product. It leaves a nice smell to the body after the bath and lasts till 8hrs easily.
I brought this for my husband and he likes it for the summer the Nivea cool kick is a good choice and Its 3 in one so worth the price.
It's an awesome shower gel as described by my brother. He loves taking a shower with this one as it gives a refreshing feel. Thanks Nykaa‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't buy if you are really looking for a cool effect. Average body shower. Don't even think about washing your face or hair with it. Far better options are available in Nivea itself.
It ok gives cool effect after bath but after some time it feels like gum on your body.
"Smells so fresh, perfect body wash for men."
"I ordered this for my brother.... He loves it, makes skin moisturise."
my skin is so soft and hydrated 
The consistency was good for a baby's cream. I bought it for my little brother and it smelled good too. Isn't something extraordinary but surely keeps the face moisturized for hours( as experimented on myself)
"Boutique baby products are good for baby skin,,this cream is good in winter season for babies."
The baby cream is very nice and also pocket friendly. must buy. 
Very good for sensitive skin of babies.
"Quite moisturizing, slightly oily but, gets absorbed after some time.
Mild scent, won't irritate anyone's nose. 
"
It completely suits my baby's skin.
This is my 2 purchase. Very gentle on the skin. Moisturize the skin. Smells good too. My daughter also uses this. 
Amazing natural fragrance and makes skin soft. Best for dry skin and best for daily use.
i cant imagine my day without this. ohh.. give a try girls. recomended
"I am using this as a day cream is really very mild, non-greasy cream.  After applying this, skin feels so fresh and supple. With the goodness of nature can use this every day."
"This baby cream is all that my baby wants. 
Pros:
Deep nourishment 
No chemical 
Inexpensive 
No skin reaction 
Keeps skin smooth and hydrated "
"Not greasy, not heavy, just the perfect level of moisturisation :)"
"Loved it , i use it before my makeup and it makes my base look super shinny.."
Works wonder on my baby's skin .... recommend everyone to use this for a single tym and u would luv this .
A little bit heavy on skin.not for summer and monsoon but best for winters.for dry skin .fragrance is little bit high.makes skin soft and moisturized. 
This is best for summer. It makes Skin Smooth and Moist. Perf for summer. 
"The product is such a great one, I use it for my own skin. The ingredients are all natural and it has no parabens or pthalates or sulphates. It's great and thick and provides intense moisturization. Great buy "
Honestly said the products of biotique are ammesing and the results are very good .
My husband loves it. It's a staple for the lazy man in the house. 
                you'll love it the fragrance is so refreshing and light. 
One of the good shower gels for men. I liked it.
Best energetic shower gel with best fragrance.
Feels so fresh and cool after using it.
Shower gel by Nivea particularly for men are exceptionally good and refreshing
Refreshing and soothing  shower gel !
Fragrance and forth formation not upto mark
Lovely smells great
"1. Lathers just fine.
2.The fragrance is quite refreshing and will charge your senses.
3. The shower gel has a decent cleansing property and will cleanse your skin thoroughly.
Cons:
1.The fragrance doesn't last long.
2.The gel is kind of watery.
3. It doesn't give a cooling or refreshing feeling."
My husband likes the texture and fragrance of product...need little amount for bath....which I love the most.
Feels so fresh and clean after this shower gel. Nice fragrance. Best use for summer 
Refreshing fragrance and works as a 3 in 1 formula.
This one leaves the skin refreshing and rejuvenated (as reviewed by a friend for whom it was bought). Highly Recommended.
Awesome product
its really effective product clean body deep
My husband loves to use it everyday..smells great and has a long lasting fragrance 
I bought for my B-Day and he loves it. Fragrance is awesome.
I bought this shower gel for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved this. Fragrance is refreshing and rejuvenating. He now uses nivea shower gels only.
Great Epire...
Got this beauty from nykaa!!! Been a big fan of avene products specifically thermal spray its gives u instant soothing feeling n reduces redness....best thing about this is it is fragrance free if u are looking for something like this go for it!!!! Holy grail of my skin care regime.... i got my 300 ml bottle which is quite large and can last you many months.....
Really soothing but less quantity according to the price 
"Is one of the main reason I love this mist is because it has no nasties, no chemicals, no fragrance and absolutely zero alcohol. In summers I find myself missing this one on my face every few hours because it genuinely hydrates my skin so well. People often say that missed do not work but this one comes my skin so much, I have gone over four bottles already and I will always keep the purchasing this!"
Avene toner is my all time favorite as it is very light weight and feels so amazing in this hot summer. It's just a bit costly that's the only Con it has.
"This is my go refresher, I always finish and start skin care with this . It never dissapoints and give me a plump skin."
Osm for summer 
A must have product. It heals like magic... some of our skin care products and trials gives us breakouts and tiny bumps..trust me this is a magic eraser for those.
love this spray sooo soo refreshing... helps alot during heat of the day
Does wonders to irritated skin. This is my 5th bottle.
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine my skin without thermale spring water. It has literally helped my skin to cope with its hyper reactive nature. It soothes my skin. Overall it‚Äôs a gud feeling.the mist is very fine .  Over a long period of time if u apply it before your moisturiser it does help with hydration levels of skin 
Works great on irritated skin! 
It works well on irritated skin. No bad reviews about this
"If you have sensitive, acne prone skin, have sunburns or irritated skin this is a savior . I just wash my face and pat dry and spray it and let it soak. Worked wonders to my super sensitive skin"
"This is really perfect for oily skin and acne prone skin. I am using this for last 6 months, my acne problem getting cured and skin also feels very fresh. "
It‚Äôs an amazing product mild soft on skin it gave relief from redness on skin even on body. It remove irritation on skin best for summer. Easy to carry while traveling love it
"Close ur eyes & buy it... U will definitely love this product.Makes my skin healthy,Instant refreshing... "
It does amazing job to my irritated n inflamed skin..
It's very good to cool your skin and keeps it hydrated.
"Finally understood why this one is a cult favorite. Does excellent does of exfoloiation without stripping away mousture. Skin feels baby soft afterwords. And the smell is to die for! Though the price is a bit high, but a must buy for a truly spa-like experience at home! "
Its first time I bought mist. Thermal water is quite good for the skin. I really liked this mist with their face wash. But not sure about buying again because of its high price. If you want some mist with this price point then blindly go for this one.. nd I would suggest to try medium size as the smaller one is quite small. I bought medium size only even if it was 1st purchase.
Delivery packaging and products were superb
It actually control oil great for oily skin 
Effective face wash for men. Oil control property is excellent
"I order it for my friend.. 
Let see what he say about this facewash."

Oil control face wash... Great for oily skin.... Use twice a day.... Bought for my brother.... 
"Awesome face wash.It helps to make skin oil free,soft n glowy"
It controls excess oil from the skin and makes skin look healthier and clean.
This face wash helps to control your excessive oil. It contains vitamin c which helps brightening your skin. 
"Himalaya face wash is best, but we didn't find good result from this product. "
Nice face wash
"Nivea product don't disappoints in most of the cases. You can easily go with them
Oil control is almost best for any facewash.
Yes, it helps in face whitening.
Little bit of refreshing.
Smells good (though for short period)
You will surely get very good results with this product."
Good
"I received my package containing this body wash by Nivea and I'm an absolute fan of this one from today! The fragrance it has is superb in all ways and it literally feels like you've bathed in liquid perfumes. The packaging is pretty amazing and so is the quantity! It's filled upto the lid which is great! I'm going to make this body wash a regular one from now. I've got tons of body washes and this is one of my top favourites üòçüíï Keep making these, Nivea!!"
Ordered for him and he is in love again.. With this body wash? not me.
Amazing
Over all good 
Very refreshing and a perfect product to gift to brothers and fathers.
This is my second purchase. My husband is so use too for this body wash. Very good for oily skin. 
This shower gel is really good.  It has small granules which exfoliate the dead cell and cleanse very well. My husband loves this shower gel very much and  use this for last 5 years. A small amount does great. Thanks Nykaa for amazing offer and speedy delivery. Definitely will buy later and recommend it to everyone. 
Ordered it for my father. Nice fragrance. Gel texture. It really refreshes your body. I'm gonna purchase it again.
Leaves a mild refreshing smell!
Even your Bathroom becomes fresh
Very nice body wash. My dad loves it and looking forward to repurchase

"refreshes skin, moisturizes,good for all soin types "
Smells  amazing and has  a good quantity  . 
The fragrance is so nice. It feels fresh!
I ordered it for my brother sins he plays a lot of football. This helps he take a nice refreshing shower. Good product.
Though being a men's product I like it and use it.
"This is a very good product for men. The fragrance is light, long-lasting. It doesn't make your skin dry. "
"Nivea is a renowned company from Germany but this product is really nice. Have been using it since last 3years, so many varieties of Nivea shower gel are available but this one is a good choice for summer."
"I always like this deodorant, particularly this one."
"It has a sweet fragrance but it doesn't last for long time. You can smell it , but others can't after 5 hrs"
This one is not a strong one like other Deo's. It is mild and long-lasting. I loved it. Bought it for my brother and he also liked it.
It smells good but it is not long-lasting.
Doesn't irritate the skin... stays for a long time on the body... smell is mild I loved this.
"Greens and musks, this is one unique scent by Adidas. Since I have been using the brand for quite some time now, and the muky and manly smell has always been magntic, in sync with the Adidas appeal. This was quite a change from the usual, and the ‚Äújungle‚Äù effect is too good. You actually feel like you are amongst a dense forest, if you close your eyes and inhale it. Kudos to Nykaa for quick delivery and superb packaging."
The fragrance is really refreshing with a musty undernote.Gives instant freshness boost but stays only upto 2-3hrs
Nice Fragrance.... Fast Delivery... Worth the discount
"Make body fresh, doesn't irritate the skin, works well and nice fragrance."
mild and a long lasting fragrance .. just loved it...
"Love it, it smells so fresh."
"Smells great and refreshing, I like to put it after shower and before gym. "
Smell is nothing out of the ordinary and also doesn't last long. Not  satisfied.
"This is one of those fragrances you like initially but becomes boring after a while. It smells too synthetic and unpleasant, also the sillage is quite poor. Won't recommend it."
"Smell is awesome but sillage and projection are very poor last only for 2 hours maximum, I'll never buy this perfume again better to go for Titan skin perfume series lasts much longer."
Awesome 
Nice
Very moisturizing.. Suitable for babies as well as adults.. very good moisturizer for dry as well as sensitive skin people.. very hydrating.. reliable product.. mild Johnson fragrance.. absorbs quickly into the skin.. good for daily use before and after bath.. I use this as my facial oil and make-up remover as well and it does its Fantastic job.. 
Best oil ever. It is multifunctional. It is a best makeup remover.  You can use it as a night moisturizer also. You can use it as a lotion too. I love this. Already used a bottle and bought second one. Recommended.
Good for babies 
Fabulous
I usually use this as cleansing oil to remove my makeup. Its affordable and works well. And I don't have to worry about anything since its a baby oil with no harsh ingredients
"I use this on my knees and elbows, and neck part. And I love it! :)"
Quantity is good
"I love this brand.. i love this baby oil.  . Awesome smell..non sticky.. can use as hair serum , as makeup remover.. its good for dry skin people "
I use this with my daily moisturizer as a body oil and it leaves my skin feeling like a baby's bottom. It has an amazing fragrance. It is a multi purpose oil. Highly recommended. 
"I apply this after washing my face at night. In the morning, skin becomes soft and shiny. Works wonder for adult and babies..."
This can be used as makeup remover
ths product is too safe for babies
Very nice please use it
"The best.
Smells amazing.
You can use for so many things."
"Just to remove my makeup, and they do their work very well."
Best vitam e enriched oil for sensitive skin
"I use it as makeup remover ..
After that i cleanse it with wipe followed by face wash"
"It's really good for babies 
And use it after waxing it'll give you shiny skin"
It's properly removes every particle from face as well as moisturizes the skin.
Love the mild smell while I wipe my face. Can be used on sensitive skin without a second thought. Must-have for summers. 
"I got this for Rs170. I have been using another brand make-up removal wipes, which is more pricey, but that made my eyes tingle most of the time. These wipes are very gentle on the skin. It smells really good and has a perfect balance of moisture in it."
It's good for adults too. I use it as facial wipes. 
Soft and best wipes for babies.
Feels so soft on skin. Amazing one
My baby skin is so soft and smooth.
This is very useful while I'm traveling or I'm out for a long day. This can be used as a makeup remover also.
I am using it from last 2years this the best thing ever for makeup remover. your makeup will go very quickly but yes not gentle on our skin. it's quite rough in texture. but very useful
It is so good. After one wipe use I can understand that.
"One of the best wipes out there in the market, Both for babies and adults! "
This is always my favorite wipes to clean makeup at the end of the day. 
The best part of this wipes are they are not harsh. Just loved it.
I use it as a makeup remover it smells amazing and good for sensitive skin.
Received the wipes through Nykaa for the 2-year-old in my house. The wipes are extremely hygienic to use. Got on a 20% discount.
These wipes are so gentle and because they are for babies they are safe enough to be used as a makeup removing wipes. And also leaves a nice fragrance
I got spread tea on my expensive top and that time I dint have anything to wipe because I was trekking then I used this to remove tea stain from my top and it works like I can't even tell that it works wonderfully.
They are very handy to use..not just with kids but to remove makeup as well
I know these are supposed to be used for babies but my friend used it as makeup wipes and I'm obsessed since then. They remove the makeup nicely even if it's sticky like mascara. These are my go to. Definitely recommend. 
I love this because it is chemical free. You can use it to wipe your face also
It's good.... I don't see the difference much though.... U can use it as lotion as well 
Makes skin little dry but smells amazing and clean well
i have been using this lotion since 2 weeks and the results are amazing. i did not feel dryness on a single day
Smell is not that good and I have used it on my stretch marks for 15 days now and can see only slightest variation maybe I should continue using it for few months.
Product is easy to apply and good in consistency. 
It moistures my skin well during winters and has a nice smell. 
It‚Äôs been just two weeks and I can see the changes in stretch mark especially on my thighs. The marks are lighter in tone now. 
It‚Äôs a nice product but you have to be patient with this one. It doesn‚Äôt do wonders in a week or month  but if used consistently it shows visible results 
I am on my second bottle. It takes time to work and can see lighten stretch marks and softens skin. 
This is the second bottle I have got which is now finishing up. Very nice two bottles almost lasted 6 months.
It does not fade the stretch marks but it's a good moisturizer.
Using evryday .... Small changes visible
My stretch marks didn‚Äôt fade.
Nice product for reducing stretch marks.
The texture is beautiful. Gets easily absorbed in the skin and has no fragrance.  
"Its a good moisturizer for people who suffer from dry skin even in summer. Doesn't feel heavy, moisturizes really well, bit thick consistency but absorbs, can be a problem if it's too hot, as it may make you sweat a bit. Not sure about stretch marks, no visible difference after two months of usage, lasts for about 3 months."
I have recently started using this product and I can see the results lightly. Hoping for it to show more results as I use it.
"1- I like the product as after applying it, it helps in keeping itching away for 10 hours approx.
2- My stretch marks keep on increasing in number as of now I have not seen any improvement.
3- The color sometimes changes from white to dark red else no changes. "
"I specially bought this product due to the reviews. its smell is nice and quite thick in consistency. However, I am waiting for the results, once I overcome my stretch marks I will edit the review definitely. "
Using this product since 4 days.hoping to see changes by 1 month end
"If you are like me who don't like to use wild smelling spray then this is for you. It has a pleasureable sweet ocean like smell!
To be Honest, it didn't last even 12 hours."
"1. Helpful for those people who cannot bear strong perfumes. It has a very mild and pleasant fragrance.
2. Price is low as compare with competitors.
3. Better than Fogg.
4. Best Scent for those people which have a headache by applying strong scent."
My brother loves it.. 
"Long lasting and also its keeps underarm odour at bay.
Go for it"
Good product loved it so much
Fragrance is absolutely freshening but lasts only for 2-4 hrs
Stays decently. It has a mild smell which is a good point.
Smells great but don't last long.
Got the deo and roll on stick. They were amazing.
I bought it for one of my friends and he loved it. The smell is little strong than other Nivea men deos but its good. I think Nivea men deos are best men deos. I personally not prefer other very strong men deos. Delivery by Nykaa was good. 
"Smells nice and fresh, not something very great but the time it lasted is what impressed me the most."
Really great for business Meetings and cooperate day to day life.
gifted it to my brother....he just loved it
It was for him... and he loved it.. Smelled good and was long lasting
"I brought this for my bro and he loved it he always buy Nivea Deo. This deo stay in 24hrs 
Pro: long lasting 
     Affordable Price
     Smell good 

"
I brought this to gift my father. He says its very refreshing and lasts around 4-5 hours. It is not too strong like other men's deo. The bottom smell of deo is kind of weired but after 20 minutes the top smell is extremely pleasing. This product is worth the price. Such a good inexpensive deo which suits every age group.He is happy with the deo.
I bought this for my husband and he  really liked this and  it became his  fav.
"Excellent deo love the Fragrance.  
                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "
I bought it last week. It has a very manly fragrance and it stays for a really long time. I carry it in my backpack and spray it only once during the break. A must try product.
Only lasts for2 hours but worth price
"Gentle for babies, very useful for everyone... You can remove light makeup also..."
I like them I used to take off my waterproof makeup and wips done it job nicely .
Its smell is good. I use it to feel fresh whenever I feel clumsy. It also works as a make up remover. For me it is the best make up remover.
I use this to remove make up :P . Works very well for my skin. There is definitely a difference in wiping off the make up with cotton balls and a wipe. I feel it nourishes the skin on continous usage. 
"Best product, I use this wet wipes to remove my makeup."
One of the best makeup removal wipes.
These are the only wet wipes I use.
I use it ..for removing makeup this is my 2nd order...I love it
Nice fragrance and quite wet.
"Very soft and very easy to clean your face, hands and so cute packaging..."
It's been more then 2 years now I've been using this product. It cleanses your skin without giving you any kind of irritation. Just loved it.
I use Johnson's baby wipes to remove my make up usually and it works wonders. Been using it for some years. It helps in removing your normal makeup as well as taking out waterproof mascara!
"It can use instead of cleanser to remove the makeup. It glides through your face very smoothly, nice smell!"
This is the best-wet wipes one should use.. No irritation on the skin... So smooth and fine.
Can be used by anyone from any age group.
As these are for babies so. Doesn't harsh on the skin. Good to use. Very mild.
nice wipes even clean the makeup (waterproof one) .. I always carry one packet in my bag.
It smells good. is pretty wet so takes off everything off the skin pretty well. I use it for my face. doesn't dry up so easily either.
"I have a sensitive skin and I use these wipes to remove my makeup especially when I am traveling. I prefer using them in packs of 10 as once opened, rest of the wipes gets dry quickly."
"I'm 20 years old and I still use these.
I use them as makeup removers or face wipes, and to date, I haven't had any skin reactions.
They're perfect!"
Gifted my dad . Awesome fragrance 
It smells good... It keeps fresh
This deo is worth to buy even the fragnance is nice
You have to just apply it on the body and its pretty good smelling also.
Smell and freshness all day long
Loved the deo. Fragrance is good too and is long-lasting.
It is very good product and I love it. 
"If you have variety of deo's and want one more, you won't be disappointed by it. The same applies if it's your first ever purchase in this category."
It is O dour free underarms non sticky. Makes you feel fresh for a long time and does it job perfectly.
"I am a college guy and it is perfect for guys like me, also good for office people."
Frangnace is very good and long lasting..
It stays till your next bath. 
This deo is really cool and worth of money. Have been using a lot of deodorants but this keeps fresh all day. It gives a really cool and fresh feeling after the application. It is non-sticky and very convenient to use. I have been using this for the last 3 months and am satisfied. The fragrance of this deo lasts for the whole day. 
"This is legit gold! I have never used roll-ons before, this is my first one. This really does all that it claims. It smells amazing, one of my favorite smells, for sure. I found it to be more long-lasting than any deo that I have used. And yeah,despite being a girl, I like this more than any other perfume meant for women. Gonna buy more for my dad and brother now!"
"It's good, Long lasting. Smells like bubblegum and citrus. Loved it a lot. "
"For summer, this product is amazing. It stays all day."
Thought it will be a spray Deodorant. But it came with roll-on applicator. Nice smell all though.
I ordered it because the smell lasts longer and feels refresh even after hours.
"I being a girl,  use it too. It's very good and smells great."
"Totally satisfied with the smell.
The smell is long-lasting.!"
Its all natural product based cream for baby which is very gentle for skin.
"I bought this moisturizer for my neice just because of the reason that it has only natural ingridients with no chemicals due to which it is completely safe for the child and also it leaves the skin super soft and velvety just lime it says and also its too inexpensive for such a good moisturizer
"
I gifted this to my newborn niece this makes her skin so smooth.
The amount of the product is worth spending money. Smells good and texture goes really good on the skin.
 it's smell is amazing.. so mild.it is.for..ur skin suits to everyone....best for dry skin...
"I'm using this cream as a hand moisturizer and trust me, it gives amazing result... Hands feel so smooth and soft..."
This baby cream has an amazing texture and it gets absorbed quickly into the skin. It makes the skin baby soft.
"For winters, it's good in moisturizing and thick in consistency."
I loved it even though I'm an adult I still use it.
"This is best baby cream I've ever used. This product is paraben free, and cause no irritation on the skin. People having dry skin like mine can use this cream."
Makes my baby's skin super soft for the entire day. I have given only one star less because there is no information on preservatives used
I am using this as my nightcream. Really it hydrates and makes my skin soft and supple when I wake up. But if you apply more quantity it will make you feel very heavy on your skin. It has nice aroma.
I liked this cream a lot. My skin is sensitive and so I prefer using baby cream most of the time. This is a perfect product for me. I have ordered It twice and love the smell of it.
Makes your skin feel so soft and the fragrance is the best
Very useful and smooth moisturizer cream for kids. Specially in winters.
I am very happy with this cream I used on my face to on winter its work very well
bought this for my friends daughter...its a good product...thank you nykaa
"I earlier wrote about the half-filled quality  I received but the effect of this cream is pretty good, quickly absorbed, light and good fragrance.  Something that is best suited for my Los dry skin. I am ordering two more for her and my niece."
"I am using this cream for myself for last one month. As my skin is very much sensitive, no product suits my skin. 
But I am satisfied with this one."
 Great smell.. Very mild but pleasant.. Moisturizing and good for kids.... My 10year old uses it at night.... Safe and good.
surely it does wht it says.. will always stick into dis spray
"The product is a boon, It is very soothing and gives a cooling effect. My skin has stopped breaking out. Love Avene, Love Nykaa. Thanks."
"one of the nicest facial sprays i've used - avene is one of those brands of sensitive skinned people and this spray is no exception
no itchiness, no scent to the product.
would recommend "
This is my first shot at spring water kind of product and I did not know many uses to it. But after reading all the reviews and recommendations online I figured this product has many uses...starting from toner to after shave. It's just refreshing. The best way to use it is after cleaning your face with a cleanser...just spray some on your face and let it air dry...works wonderful. My acne are at bay and skin has a beautiful glow. Love it !
One of the most sorted and easy to use product. I travel a lot and often my skin take a toll cause of pollution and climate change but this handy product is always in my bag. Just fetch and spray. Instant hydration and feels good on your skin. A must have for everyone!
"The spring water is a must have for sensitive skin. Recommended by dermatologists post treatments. I am currently on the 3rd bottle & absolutely love it. It helps bring down the acne inflammation, allergy, sunburn & rashes. Could also be used as a Toner if you do not wish to use too many chemicals on the skin. It's pricy but worth every bit of it!"
"I purchased the 50 ml can to test the hype surrounding thermal spring water. Have been using this every day after cleansing, at work, after workout and have finished the bottle within a month.
 
The effect:
1)Immediate soothing and calming effect
2) My skin feels healed

Have ordered two more (for me and mom!!)Recommended for all!
"
This product is amazing and works really well for my combination acne prone skin. It just stands out in terms of efficiency.Totally worth it. 
I just love this blissful and perfect product. This is my second bottle. I would definitely repurchase and recommend this.
"IT IS A MULTI PURPOSE SPRAY!!
IT HEALS SUNBURNS AND MINOR CUTS OR WOUNDS
IT REFRESHES SKIN AFTER WORKOUT
ALSO WORK AS MAKE UP SETTING SPRAY
TRAVEL FRIENDLY
SPRAY IT ON FACE WHENEVER YOU FEEL DULL OR EXHAUSTED
BEST FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
LOVE IT!!"
It instantly gives you that refreshing look after having a tiring day. It‚Äôs really good if you spray  after or before makeup.
I like to spritz this on my skin before putting on moisturiser. Feels refreshing on the skin on hot days.
The spray is great for dry sensitive skin. Helps calm down skin irritations and redness and softens the skin too. I would repurchase this.
this is genuinely a good product . my skin has been getting very red lately .it calms it upto 80 percent . i would love to buy this always even if it doesnt give 100 prcnt results bt the price is literally too much .if i dont control myself from spraying many times (i want to ) it would hv been over in a week
"Reduces redness within minutes
Refreshment when sprayed over face 
Calms ultra sensitive skin down "
Product is nice.. but its little on expensive side if compared with quantity.. 
"Having sensitive skin is big trouble .... During my prebridal services I tend to have redness nd iching on my skin 
... This product really helps me to sooth my skin ..... Nd specially best for summers"
It calms down the skin instantly. Perfect for summer and irritated skin
Feels good on skin..but nothing magical
It‚Äôs good for almost all skin types. It refreshes the skin and doesn‚Äôt  dry it out like some other mists. I would recommend it
Love this baby oil. It is mild and the fragrance is also very pleasant.
"Good for face but for body, it dries very fast and doesn‚Äôt hydrate much."
It can be used as a makeup remover.
Before and after bath using it. So soft smooth skin your baby. Love so much.
One of the best multi-purpose products at a very considerable price. Just love it!
I use this as makeup remover does great job.
Its a must have oil for various purposes. Light and effective. I use it as a massage oil. Makes my skin super smooth and supple.
"I use this baby oil as an eye make up remover. It removes makeup in just one swipe with no residue left behind, Will recommends this to everyone who is not willing to splurge on makeup removers."
Best baby oil. Good choice for babies & excellent makeup remover.
It's very useful even for adults it also worked good in hairs when applied on wet hair and also it gives shine to them.
"I have been using this oil since years now and quality is still the same. This can be used as makeup remover,  aftershave and as night cream too."
This is the best product I've used so far for removing makeup. Takes off stubborn eye makeup very easily. Love it.!
Multi-purpose product...must have this...
It smells so good & it makes your face soft. I used it for face oil.
"I use it as my moisturizer at night. It works for dry skin n I'm not sure for oily skin, it makes a breakout. I use as eye cream n lip balm for soft lips. Its fragrance is so mild."
It very easily removes makeup. I use this to remove eyeliner n lipstick. Very effective.
"I always have this product handy, as it can be used in many ways. I sometimes use it as a makeup remover, and sometimes for moisturizing my skin at night. We don't have any babies at home, so don't know the product's credibility in that area. :)"
"It's not just an oil. It can be used as a moisturizer, makeup remover, under eye cream, cuticle care and so many more things. An all round product !"
Smells awesome.. Comes at a reasonable price. Just the way it should be. Smells so good. As we always cherish and nurture the bond between Johnson and Johnson
Happy with product
Very gentle on the skin and efficient in removing makeup without leaving any residue. Great for travelling or just to keep in your bag. A variety of sizes makes this product very handy.
I regularly use it and I get a very fresh and soft skin.  I am in love with it ‚ò∫
"This baby wipes I use it for my makeup, whenever I want to remove my makeup so I am using this because this is very gentle and good quality."
"This is one of the best makeup wipes, it takes off all the layers of makeup and doesn't cause any breakouts at all. Also very hydrating and doesn't have any smell which helps. "
I used it once and now I am a regular user of this. It soaks extra oil from my face without drying it.
"Actually, I got it for makeup purpose I wud b sad to say that it works good for the body but not for face yeah sorry to say but its fibre is ruff for facial skin .so plz don't buy for makeup. In itself, its a decent product nice smell works great just for swipe on face and neck but not the body."
I have been using this product to remove my makeup whenever i am tired. Its harmless. Love it
Apart from using for your child as swipes at every juncture from cleaning hands when out to bum wipes when infants...These are amazing for removing the makeup as well
smells like babies... and is very gentle on skin
I just love this product for they are multipurpose and suit my sensitive skin.
These work nicely. Have a light scent. Great for everyday use.good makeup removers and very moisturizing.
It is my go-to product. All time favorite. smells nice. Can be used for multiple purposes. Buying it again.
"Every night, makeup or not i wipe my face and neck. Not only it removes the dirt but keeps skin fresh and smells amazing. Key to eye makeup removal is keep it on your eye lid closed for a minute and swipe off, it takes off everything. Plus keeps me away from all the other harsh chemicals and a pimple free skin. Thanks johnsons & nykaa"
Best makeup remover wipes
These wipes can be well used as face wipes and they are very gentle on the skin. Also cleanses make up and dirt very well.
Each time i use these I experience  soft and supple sheets with great Johnson's baby fragrance. I carry them in my bag as a part of my everyday essential kit.
It is a great product not only for babies but for everyone its so soft n do it job perfectly i am using it from past 5 years and now i cnt think of any other product .especially its 80pc pack have plastic top cover which help it from drying which is best.
it has got a very good fragrance. Not too rough very soft.
"My sis & I trust Johnson's, always mild, gentle & effective.
Even my 2 years old niece loves it. She mimics us and uses it to wipe her face. It even contains baby lotion. It also helps soothe skin by removing flakiness of dry and cracked skin. We use it for ourselves also, sometimes as a make-up remover."
It is very moistrurising and easy to remove make up with this

"I have used various adidas deos, almost all of them but this one has the strongest smell. It lasts for 5-6 hours and gives a smell some what the smell of a lemon.

P.S. -  Having a lemon type of a smell doesn't mean the smell is bad"
Team Force is one of nice deo you can use anytime .. this is not strong it will give you some fresh feel.. but I can say it is not long lasting... 
Not so happy with the fragrance. Stays for 10 mins only. Don't try.
Awesome fragrance women also can apply. 
"This is the best deodorant available in the market and it smells so good! I  have bought this particular deodorant for my brother, and he loves it too! It is affordable and it lasts all day long!"
Got for dad. He loved it. All Nivea deos are great.

I bought this product for my brother and he loved it.
"The smell is very poor with no staying capacity. I bought it to use in the gym but it can't survive even 5 minutes, let alone a gym workout. Please don't buy. It's definitely not a sports deo."
5 star for the quality of product and service.
All Adidas deodorants are good for mild fragrance lovers
"It has a good smell. I liked it. 
One can buy it from nykaa because of a very attractive price
"
I really love it. The smell is very fresh and sporty. It stands out in crowd. I specially love the Icy cool feeling after spraying it. Great for casual as well as office use. I definitely recommend it!
It is one of those fragrances that I would recommend every guy to try once and I guarantee it will permanently in your all time favorite collection... 
"Just try this, fragrance is good, not too strong, keep the body fresh and cool."
My bro love to use this .. Not too strong doesn't irritate the skin... Definitely try this one.
Reallly nice product at affordable price. And it is coming from known brand. I have used this product and i always loved it. They have not infalted their proces so it is really good thing. I really recommend you all this product and give it a try once. Other flavours of thid product is alsk good and you can give it a try
The fragrance is good no doubt but it's too mild and sometimes it can only be smelled when you smell it from close( a good way to get someone closer)
Very disappointed and dissatisfied with the delivery. The bottle was not sealed.
does not work as a deodorant at all not even for an hour. 
"Love its fragrance. Thanks, Nykaa, for discount.
"
This product is good for summers and it has very nice fragrance.
This product was a gift to my friend and he really liked it for everyday use.
One of the reasons is that this product is available original on this site whereas i recieved duplicate from other site
Gifted this to a dear one! The smell is just awesome and it is long lasting. Love it!!
Good fragrance and very effective.
Fragrance Good but not long lasting in one day
Smell very nice and refreshing 
Gifted it to my daddy and he liked it very much
Stays for 8 plus hours. Fragrance is awesome!
"Superb deodorant, I gifted this to my husband he loves the smell very much, soothing and long-lasting heavenly smell."
Liked the smell and delivery was very quick and nicely packed too.
"Gifted this to my dad on his birthday, and he just loved it. Worth the purchase. "
The fragrance is really nice and Nykaa always provide the original. So happy to recommend to anyone looking for a good deo for men.
I gifted this to my brother. It stayed longer and the smell is very refreshing.
I just like this smell. Bought this one for myself. It gives cool calming vibes. Go for it.
My brother has a huge collection of body spray from various brands but from the day I gift him this spray he has just gone crazy for this. From that day he uses just this spray and nothing else.
This is a great deo and it lasts for a long time. It doesn't fade away.
 I love the fragrance of this. Gifted this to my brother and it is his fav deo now!          
My husband bought it and its actually really nice. Stays on for long and it doesn't gives me any headache which is a good thing.
Needful thing

Good wipes...useful in makeup removal too

"it is so good,  moisturizes your skin"
Nic product

I use it most of the times when I'm out.. it makes my face look fresh 
Best product...good for skin

Although its meant for baby's but it suits senstive skin too removes all dirt in single swipe and its way better than kara
"Can be used as a baby wipe, and a perfect makeup remover as well."
"Soft, good fragrance, strong packaging "
I highly recommend this wipe to all for babies and for adults as well. I doesnot feel hard on skin and no chances of dkin rashes. Thumbs up for this product
"20 sheets in this pack.
Good According tp the range"
I always use this wipes. It can wipe out all dust from your skin.
"While these are baby wipes, I use them as makeup removers. Trust me, they remove makeup in literally one swipe, and one wipe is good enough to take off layers of makeup. They also leave the skin feeling moisturized"
People use for baby I use for makeup clean very gentle soft nd supple 
"I love Nivea since a very long time and I just love almost all the products of Nivea. It doesn't darken your underarms area which deodorants do. So, in my opinion, it is a must-buy product for summer."
"Good communication Ousm service

Delivery on time Cum"
It's amazing I hit bottom on the first one and ordered again. It's amazing and last long. It's not particularly a female product but since no women's perfume or deo lasts long enough for us to get out of the house this one's nice. It's stays on the whole day and no irritation or skin darkening.
"It's a good non irritant product, n it almost lasts upto 8hrs..."
Supper for man deodorant who hate spray deodorant. Try this product. No irritation on skin. 
The fragrance is great and long lasting. The masculine musky smell provides just the right push in the confidence.
"Long lasting upto 12 hrs with a strong, pleasant odour"
Nice does not leave white marks on your  clothes.
best best roll on.. nivea men all product the best must try
"genuine products supplied, delivery service very good, products received before eatimated delivery date. product quality was satisfactory, i like this type of service. good keep it up  "
"It has a gel texture , smell is nice it's not too strong , overall it's amazing"
"I love this roll on...this is my 4th purchase, you can go with this without any second thought. Its stay for more than 48hrs."
Ordered for my brother. Does the job pretty decently 
Its good for use... apply after shower and tada you are done  for the day... no need of getting conscious 
I bought it for my brother. It has a nice mild fragrance which may not last for a long time. But main advantage is it controls sweat and keeps you away from the body odour. 
good product awsm fragrance ......good for both girls and boys ???loving it. 
Mild fragrance and owesome deo i like it?
All are product very stunning... Delivery time is very fast....Satisfied
"Worth each penny . Also, fragrance is not that strong and helps in controlling the sweat"
I liked it ..I gifted to my friend .. he loved it. Affordable at price also 
Makes you feel really fresh. Cools down the body. Smell is amazing. Must have after workout for summers. 
Very strong bodywash with a good scent. Exactly what my husband was looking for. 
It has a nice smell but doesn't last much longer
I keeps my body fresh and makes me feel good. Gives a strong fragrance but it will keep you out of sweat smell for hours. If u have excessive sweating problem.then this is for you.
"Great product , smeels amazing ... Bst body wash for boys . I made a combo of many products including this body wash and gifted to my brother"
I love this one. The fragrance is like a deodorant keeps you fresh for long duration. I like it!
One of the best body wash from adidas.
Awesome product. Smells really good. And lasts for a long time.
The product lathers really well and the smell is very manly and strong the perfect body wash you need after a tiring day. Though it is for men my sister also uses it and she loves the strong aroma the smell stays long.....and it fills you up with energy....a great buy. 
Perfect for the most workout. Just what I need. Going to buy my second bottle soon.
Brought for the husband and I ended up using. 
I am a regular customer and I just love how the effect this body wash has on my skin it's creamy and really effective with regular use.
This shower gel is so relaxing and refreshing. It smells amazing as well.
This product smells heaven. I am a girl but I use this product because the place I live is very humid and I sweat a lot so I usually prefer using men's deodorants and body washes! I workout a lot and after that taking a shower with this is something you can enjoy the most.
Fragrance lasts less not worth
The shower gel is very thin. It looks like diluted with something.
"I ordered this for my brother.... He loves it, makes skin moisturise."
my skin is so soft and hydrated 
The consistency was good for a baby's cream. I bought it for my little brother and it smelled good too. Isn't something extraordinary but surely keeps the face moisturized for hours( as experimented on myself)
"Boutique baby products are good for baby skin,,this cream is good in winter season for babies."
The baby cream is very nice and also pocket friendly. must buy. 
Very good for sensitive skin of babies.
"Quite moisturizing, slightly oily but, gets absorbed after some time.
Mild scent, won't irritate anyone's nose. 
"
It completely suits my baby's skin.
This is my 2 purchase. Very gentle on the skin. Moisturize the skin. Smells good too. My daughter also uses this. 
Amazing natural fragrance and makes skin soft. Best for dry skin and best for daily use.
i cant imagine my day without this. ohh.. give a try girls. recomended
"I am using this as a day cream is really very mild, non-greasy cream.  After applying this, skin feels so fresh and supple. With the goodness of nature can use this every day."
"This baby cream is all that my baby wants. 
Pros:
Deep nourishment 
No chemical 
Inexpensive 
No skin reaction 
Keeps skin smooth and hydrated "
"Not greasy, not heavy, just the perfect level of moisturisation :)"
"Loved it , i use it before my makeup and it makes my base look super shinny.."
Works wonder on my baby's skin .... recommend everyone to use this for a single tym and u would luv this .
A little bit heavy on skin.not for summer and monsoon but best for winters.for dry skin .fragrance is little bit high.makes skin soft and moisturized. 
This is best for summer. It makes Skin Smooth and Moist. Perf for summer. 
"The product is such a great one, I use it for my own skin. The ingredients are all natural and it has no parabens or pthalates or sulphates. It's great and thick and provides intense moisturization. Great buy "
Honestly said the products of biotique are ammesing and the results are very good .
Good fragrance and stays on for 4 to 5 hours.
"Lasts enough for the occasion like party or any other function, around 3-4 hours. Smell is nice. "
The fragrance spread after some time. And stays for a while. This is the highlight of this perfume.
Gifted it to my dad..and he loves it. Smells quite decent.
"The product is really good and the mild fragrance stays for 6 to 7 hours. If you want to buy this product, just go for it."
"Completely a sporty perfume, Best to use in a Gym."
"i like the spray and the bottle. the fragnace smells really good ,too good for its price. only thing bad about it is that the fragrance lasts a very short while and it is not intense. I would recommend to purchase the deo instead of the perfume as the deo as approximately the same time but it's much cheaper and a little better smelling too"
I ordered this for my husband !! Little strong smell according to me !!!!   But it's good for men's.
Just awesome. It is an amazing product. Go for it. I've bought it for my brother. he really likes it.
It did not match my expectation. The fragrance is good but doesn't stay long. Can find better product in this price range. 
"The product has a fruity smell. It is good for sports purposes and not for functions. The smell doesn't last that long, but the base smell remains for up to the next day. If you go to the gym, or other physical activities, it won't let you smell bad."
At the time of application it smells fine and nice once sweat produces fragrance fades...
"Not worthy. It's better to go for deo than adidas. I was expecting a decent strong smell but it smells of 200rs deodorant and not 700. Will look forward to buying wild stone, that's better."
The fragrance is good but not long-lasting. It stays only for hours. 
Its good enough for casual day use I have been using these past few months quite long lasting too and very reasonable price on Nykaa.
"Amazing product, fragrance is long lasting and unique, affordable too."
Very nice and good for gym purpose and lavender flavor is just awesome.
I am using this product from last 2 years. It‚Äôs very good :)
"I bought this product for my husband as a gift, because the fragrance of this product is superb, and he always loves this brand because its long lasting and good quality. "
A beautiful product from Adidas.I gifted it to my brother and he loved it and it actually smells really nice.
Got this beauty from nykaa!!! Been a big fan of avene products specifically thermal spray its gives u instant soothing feeling n reduces redness....best thing about this is it is fragrance free if u are looking for something like this go for it!!!! Holy grail of my skin care regime.... i got my 300 ml bottle which is quite large and can last you many months.....
Really soothing but less quantity according to the price 
"Is one of the main reason I love this mist is because it has no nasties, no chemicals, no fragrance and absolutely zero alcohol. In summers I find myself missing this one on my face every few hours because it genuinely hydrates my skin so well. People often say that missed do not work but this one comes my skin so much, I have gone over four bottles already and I will always keep the purchasing this!"
Avene toner is my all time favorite as it is very light weight and feels so amazing in this hot summer. It's just a bit costly that's the only Con it has.
"This is my go refresher, I always finish and start skin care with this . It never dissapoints and give me a plump skin."
Osm for summer 
A must have product. It heals like magic... some of our skin care products and trials gives us breakouts and tiny bumps..trust me this is a magic eraser for those.
love this spray sooo soo refreshing... helps alot during heat of the day
Does wonders to irritated skin. This is my 5th bottle.
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine my skin without thermale spring water. It has literally helped my skin to cope with its hyper reactive nature. It soothes my skin. Overall it‚Äôs a gud feeling.the mist is very fine .  Over a long period of time if u apply it before your moisturiser it does help with hydration levels of skin 
Works great on irritated skin! 
It works well on irritated skin. No bad reviews about this
"If you have sensitive, acne prone skin, have sunburns or irritated skin this is a savior . I just wash my face and pat dry and spray it and let it soak. Worked wonders to my super sensitive skin"
"This is really perfect for oily skin and acne prone skin. I am using this for last 6 months, my acne problem getting cured and skin also feels very fresh. "
It‚Äôs an amazing product mild soft on skin it gave relief from redness on skin even on body. It remove irritation on skin best for summer. Easy to carry while traveling love it
"Close ur eyes & buy it... U will definitely love this product.Makes my skin healthy,Instant refreshing... "
It does amazing job to my irritated n inflamed skin..
It's very good to cool your skin and keeps it hydrated.
"Finally understood why this one is a cult favorite. Does excellent does of exfoloiation without stripping away mousture. Skin feels baby soft afterwords. And the smell is to die for! Though the price is a bit high, but a must buy for a truly spa-like experience at home! "
Its first time I bought mist. Thermal water is quite good for the skin. I really liked this mist with their face wash. But not sure about buying again because of its high price. If you want some mist with this price point then blindly go for this one.. nd I would suggest to try medium size as the smaller one is quite small. I bought medium size only even if it was 1st purchase.
I have also used body spray from adidas they were pathetic but hands down this edt. Omg my clothes smells of this perfume. And it has such a luxurious fragrance. I have been asked about this fragrance by my colleagues. Loved it
"Light scent. Good for office and casual use, last for 4-5 hours."
Doesn't really last that long but very good for the price. 
The smell is really pleasant and long staying. Not a strong smell.!
"It made a perfect gift for a colleague...he loved it! Also, he smells better now"
I bought this for my dad and he absolutely loved it. It has a nice fragrance that is not too overpowering.
"The fragrance is just like any average sporty deodorant. Also, this isn‚Äôt very long-lasting and was hardly noticeable. Instead, go for perfumes that are established and within your budget."
Loved it... it's quite amazing and 100%original Adidas...
"Though pricy but nice, not.to strong fragrance. Try this."
It's a very nice product. The fragrance is also very nice. Love it.
smell of this is good... Not to strong ... my mom and bro use this... they love this
"It has a very strong smell, so this is not for those people who are into mild fragrances. For strong scent lovers, this is a boon. It is a nice purchase. This smells a little like aftershave, but that is what most of the men's perfumes do I guess."
It smells very nice. Gets you pumped and keeps you fresh and is long-lasting.
"He liked the fragrance, but it does not last for twenty-four hours as claimed by Adidas. "
This is the first time Nykaa has disappointed me. It is like you have sprayed water devoid of any fragrance. Totally disappointed.!
Very goood fragrance for men. Very reasonable.
When sprayed for the first time the fragrance was very ordinary but after some time the fragrance was mesmerising 
"The smell is subtle but long Lasting, gives fresh vibe and is perfect for those who work."
"Smells great, stays long enough. Cant go wrong with the brand"
"Fragrance is nice, more towards fruity smell."
Beautiful fresh cheapie for summers...Just spray liberally n you are good to go...Performance is also decent for the price... bang for the buck         
"Mild fragrance, awesome one after having morning shower."
Very nice product and fragrance is amazing.
Smell average but first 2hours it keeps you up from everyone
The fragrance is good but doesn't stay. It leaves stain on clothes so I suggest not to buy.
Always a yes for this cool fragrance
Smell is nice. Would be better if long Lasting.
"yes it is good i dont know why so many people didn't receive this or there's no hype about this particular product honestly i love the smell of ut ut us very refreshing and light, i would say yes you can invest your money on this if your like icey and cooling refreshing smell ?"
"if u like strong perfume, it's not it... 5 mins later, u can't smell nothing. useless product for a brand.. doesn't smells good, neither stays for long. 
"
"Nice product, good fragrance, lasts for a decent time."
Awesome smell. I gifted my brother he loved it. 
The fragrance is good and mild. It can be used for daily purposes. It stains your clothes which is a drawback.
"Icy summer fragrance. Can keep it ready at hand (in office or car) when your morning perfume has waned off by mid-afternoon. Best thing: it starts off with kiwi and mint, and dries down to musk and tonka bean."
As my husband recommend Adidas ice dive amazing fragrance.
"Gets an immediate fresh smell which wears off quickly in a couple of hours. Does not stay if you sweat. 
"
It has very awesome fragrance......feels very fresh.......also is long lasting
Ordered for my dad ! He absolutely loves this and Brut original
Like the fragrance and last for long time... 
It has a very unique pleasant fragrance. Longetivity is average
It smells good but doesn't last long.
The smell not even lasts for 10 Minutes 
This is the worst smell you will ever expect from any deo! It smells like Navaratan oil. Worst!
I buy it the first time .one of my friend suggested me to buy this..truly its fragrance is very very good and stayed for a long time..thank my friend and Nykaa.
"Buyed offline, if you are passionate about quality perfumes, this must be in your collection...  Definitely, you will love this... It feels fresh,  powdery..."
Jovan Musk Deo is really good! The refreshing smell of the Deo stays the whole day and keeps the odor away. Perfect Deo for men!!!           
Bought it for my father. He liked it. Good for everyday use.
"goodproduct, i love it"
"Its got a lovely fragrance. 
Good for daily use "
This is a unique fragrance with woody undertones... Perfect for evenings and formal meetings. Old time favourite. 
It's not like a tipical body deo kinda thing..  it has that colongue vibes in it.. kinda like a perfumy smell !! Love it .. that's my go to .. this deo defines me .. just awesome !!! 
"Old Timer
Will last for few hours. Try it once, then keep recommending. "
Smells good but too strong! 
"I am a huge fan of the Jovan musk perfume range, I have been using the orange and the white variant for quite a long time and so I thought of giving this a try. But I must say that this one is not so long lasting even though the smell is good. So if you want a long lasting perfume you should use the white variant."
Useless product
Good for skin in winters
"This is a must skin care product
Moisturizer+highlighter+face serum+gooooooodnessss....."
"In love with this baby oil, it gives you very smooth and soft skin.
You can use this as a moisturizer for your face. "
"Since I work as a beauty blogger I already have to spend so much of my money on products, and facial oils are extremely expensive. So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil warm up in my hands and just tap it on my face.So before make up I always take a little bit of Johnson baby oil, warm up in my hands and just dab it on my face. This makes the make up to melt on my skin so beautifully and also that Makeup stays for long. I don‚Äôt use any other serum or facial oil, all I do is use this and it works literally the best for me. 
You can see how beautiful it looks when I apply the oil before my makeup. Also this is so in expensive, literally the best"
"First of all i just love its smell? if u have frizzy hair or u dont use conditioner, a few drops of it will do magic. Use it after shampooing on wet hair too. "

Really good wet wipes .very gentle and soft
Its so moist and moisturizing. Very good for using on babies. Rash - free and nice fragrance. The best wipes not only for baby but also for adults looking for wet wipes.

While it is for baby. But i use it as make up remover and freshen up my skin. Lovely
"This is budget friendly, and I also used it for wiping my face, I love it."
I'm using this product to remove my makeup for a couple of years now. I couldn't find any other make up removal wipe as good as this one. This is very gentle on my skin. Removes my waterproof mascara like magic with one swipe. This is very moist. 
"Very good quality to be trusted, love Nykaa's products."
It is not only used for babies. It can also be used for makeup remover wipes  for soft and glowing skin.
"Though it is a baby wipe I use it as my makeup remover and trust me it is way better than any makeup remover wipes I used till date. Soft on skin, removes even my kajal. Nice Fragrance. "

One of the most Loved Razors that men have been using for years now.......‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Comes as expected. Good quality blades. Gives a nice shave without any hassles.  razors can even be reused . 
"5 h aur ense aap saving kr skte h 
Under arms b shave kr skte h 
Thanks nykaa"
Cheap affordable & very well ..love nykaa 
Ordered this for my father. He has been using these for many years. Good product
I ordered this for my father. And he is happy.
For lockdown times.. It is the most useful and economic pack for men
Its cost effective and same to same as of female razor but at much lower price..
Does the job well and the best part is the price point 
It's a moderate product. Not impressed
"I swear by this now, is super pocket friendly plus you can use them for longer. "
Nice and sharp razors. Each blade Can be used 4 to 5 times
Worth the price. Lasts longer than other disposable razors I have used in the same price range
Do not buy venus razors for especially women. It makes no sense to pay 150 extra jus to remove hair with a pink handle. Works better than any other method of hair removal.
"No complains, classic. Good buy. "
Does a decent job. Very affordable razors. Not very sharp so won't give nicks and cuts
Ordered this for my father..Gives you clean shave.
 I have been using since college  days and still a fan of it.best part is its price and sharpness. Always exfoliate one day before shaving and shave with conditioner or shave lotion. U will love the experience. 
This is very cheap and travell friendly pack.. good one
It's gud for daily use and can be used for 4-5days.
Love its smell. Lasts for long.
"Nivea always fulfil what Indian men want. Aqua, fresh, long-lasting, neutral and budget friendly too. "
I am female still I like the smell of this male deo. It is long-lasting and reasonable also. Girls go for it!!

"I just love the fragrance of this Nivea fresh active original spray as it long-lasting plus, it keeps a person fresh throughout the day... Thanks to Nykaa."
Ordered this for my father. He absolutely loves the khushboo and it is long-lasting too. A must for summers
"I pick this one for my hubby. He liked it a lot, and what they mention it stays 48hrs, exactly staying as it is. Nice fragrance."
The smell is very nice... I gave this to my husband... and he just loved this... The smell is very good neither very light nor very strong but long-lasting...
It smells so amazing amd refreshing. I bought this for my husband and he loved it. 
"This is deodrant is refreshing, skin friendly and extremely affordable! Never leave any white cast on shirts or t-shirt after using. "
"I gifted this to my husband and he liked it very much.
Those who are confused what to give to your man, this is the perfect choice."
Fragrance is manageable..I bought it for my dad..he liked it
I love this deo. Amazing fragrance but stay is fine.
Smells good and fresh and active good deodrant with soothing odour. Lasts all day long using it from past couple of years and best part is doesn't leave irritating smell on clothes.
I loved the smell its very manly
"My spouse has been using it for quite sometime now.
No complaints "
                I brought for my brother and he loved it as he felt fresh for many hours. Asusual nivea proved it.
This keeps me feeling fresh for hours. Love the scent 
Very fresh and long-lasting fragrance.
Nice and good smell. I love this product.
Extremely amazing fragrance.Easy to carry whenever you go.Really refreshing. Loved it!??
I also use it to remove makeup for the days my skin is extra sensitive or my skin barrier acts weird very soothing 
These are extremely soft and of very good quality.  Good on the face for removing packs and makeup
Baby wipes is tooo good for me i m doing daily ctm firstly i use this wipes and baby wipes fragrance is good  mild  fragnance 
Its good for use..but will have to toil a bit for makeup removal
I use it as a makeup remover and honestly this one smells better than  kaya baby wipes 
Its really soft for babies delicate skin and you can also use as a makeup remover works pretty well... No side effects ??
"Really moisturising , cleansing and helps remove make up very well "
"it has a good fragrance, good for sensitive skin too"
I like baby products and also its useful... 
I have use so many wet wipes but only this on is suitable for my skin.  So i am using this for remove my makeup
Amazing wipes to remove makeup and feel really soft.
Very useful. I always used this Johnson facial wipes. It removes all the makeup properly. 
                This is a best wipes . I highly recommend to buy this
                Moisturize well n clean well
"                This product is very good.it is soft because it is for baby
Definitely try it"
"It is such a useful thing. I use it to clean my face, light makeup and even sanitizing my phones laptops etc.?"
Always rely upon Johnson! My summer days are incomplete without this wipes. It keeps my skin hydrated
"I often use baby wipes to remove light makeup, and I have to say that Johnson‚Äôs wipes are one of the affordable ones available in the market which aren‚Äôt too harsh on the skin."
favourite skin wipes otherwise i dont use anyother skin wipes beacause they make my skin looks black but it doesn't
I brought it for my dad and he really liked it. Long lasting. 
Excellent product for personal use. For men
" It does what it says - tick
Underarms fresh all day -tick
Affordable-tick
Awesome fragrance-tick
48hrs claim- i take a bath twice a day so cant really comment on that one lol 
But, overalll Nivea never disappoint .. "
I got this for my husband and trust me it's true to what it claims. Deodorants fade after a couple of hours but it stays for long. Really a good product for fighting harsh and strong male odour.
"seeing the price and the quality, it's a very good product."
No more embracing feeling..  feels good..
An innovative product giving which has a very good fragrance.
Bought this for my brother. He's satisfied with the product
Ordered this for my husband he loved it.
Feels so refreshing 
"This is my 2nd purchase, nice fragrance. bought this for my boyfriend."
Control odour upto 24hrs.....long lasting fragrance.... 
Got this for my brother and he likes it. Has no alcohol as such so safe to use daily and it lasts long so good to go. Always been a Nivea fan!!
I brought this for my husband.....he is very happy while using this roll-on because it has fresh refreshing fragrance whole day long .... Thnkuuuu Nykaa üòòüòò
"                It smells...Aaaamazing.
It has clear solution which doesn't dryout my underarms at all. Thumbs Up!
"
"Roll-ons are way better than aerosol deodorant. Great smell, which is long-lasting and it‚Äôs the best part."
I have used Nivea protect and care (Women) but I must say this one is fantastic. Even girls can also use this Amazing. Control underarm odor and sweat. Loved this!
I m using this last 1 yr this is what i want for my daily use
Nice fragrance. Perfect for men who don't like strong deos.
I ordered it for my brother and he loved it. It has nice long lasting fragnance. It does not give irritation to the skin.
Makes ur skin oily after sometime 
I find my baby complexion has becoming dull by using this cream 
"It would have been nice if it had mild fragrance 
And its too oily "
Nothing great. Just okayish. The fragrance is a bit weird. 
I m using this as hands cream.its moisturizes well n gives non sticky texture. But can't say abt how it works on babies.
I used from 2 months ..my baby skin colour change ..not good cream
This is good one but its smell is to harsh and irritating.
Nothing is magically about it but not bad at this price.
Surprisingly heavy in the face and a very strong smell
nothing great. but isnt bad as well a normal cream
It's good for winters but I don't think it's suitable for oily skin people. I personally think that Himalaya baby cream is far better and even it brightens your face instantly and moreover prevents pimple!
"This lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy, so it's great for use on the body, especially on hands. However, when I used it on my face, it gave me little bumps on my forehead and along my jawline (malassezia). Therefore, please don't use it on your face if you are maleassezia prone like me."
Eye is burning badle. And product is soso
"During winter, it is very good for dry skin, I like it because it keeps my children skin soft and moisture well, its not greasy keeps them looking fair all through the winter time. "
Very good face cream for babies 
Always my favourite brand biotique   Good moisturiser I brought this for myself  fragrance is mild very good for dry skin people thanksüëçüèª
It's soft and smooth 
My little brother is 6 years old he loves it.
"It's super cream I have used 8 tubes already. 
It keeps skin hydrated and coconut content gives clear bright skin.
I use it as a night cream which is very soothing."
I started using it 5 yrs ago.. now i use it as my night time hand and foot cream.. and this is THE BEST night time hand and foot cream for me..
It's a very great mist. It makes skin calming and refreshed.
"Good for redness, instantly soothes and cool down the skin. The best for dry sensitive skin."
"Using this product during summers, brings a refreshing glow on the skin and during winters keeps the skin hydrated. I would recommend its purchase. "
This product is a boon to sensitive skin beauties. My recommendation- use after refrigeration for better results
"Also, acts as a good makeup setting spray. "
"I loved this product. Soothes my skin immediately after application. Especially after walking in sun. However, it's price is its big con."
"This could be used as a primer for oily skin. I‚Äôve a T zone, therefore I use it on a particular portion only. But it helps in reducing acne build up.!"
It's a good product for sensitive skin.
"It's one of the best product. Just one spray and your skin is hydrated instantly. I use it twice  as a toner and also for those itchy, bumpy skin problems. "
This spray calms and soothes the skin very effectively. Used it after removing makeup and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated. Love it.
"I was having severe acne, but this product is a miracle. Just spray it 2-3 times a day. You will see visible results in just one week. Thank you, Nykaa, for this amazing product. "
"You name the skin care brand and I know it. Had lot of trouble due to skin problem  while growing up and then the love for skin care started this one is a boom for the sensitive skin. I have roseacia , rashes, allergies and occasional breakouts. And spraying this thermal spring water really soothes my skin and reduces rosacea."
Its a great product to keep in your purse great during travelling.
Helps a lot to control oiliness itching and burning sensation on skin.
"This doesn't dry up the skin and after researching over and over again, I've bought this toner and it is the best ever. Doesn't contain alcohol, no paraben, no sulphates!"
"I bought this product after I saw Michelle Phan using it in her Instagram Story for soothing her post-laser treated skin. I bought it right away as it was on sale in Nykaa. It really does soothe my skin after I got my chemical peel treatment. I sometimes use it as a toner too. However, the price is quite high."
Good choice for the beginner‚Äôs who are not used face sprays. This spray is gentle enough it doesn‚Äôt harm the eyes even if gets into it! Don‚Äôt cause any breakouts feels refreshing. 
Refreshing and keeps acne at bay. What else do you need!
I really loved it. It helps in soothing my skin and makes it fresh.
"I have tried it on myself as well as my friend who had severe acne problem. It simply soothes your skin, without harming them does its job. What more can you ask for. It's always in my bag whenever I am going outside in the sun. Helps soothe sunburn like a boss."
I applied this oil on my hair and body. My skin and hair feel so soft and amazing.
"Ladies, if you have dry skin: try this after bathing and see the difference in 5 days. It is quick in absorption, leaves your skin hydrated for upto 8 hrs and is a good make up remover too."
"I've been using the past 2 months now. It is great to use. It works well as a moisturizer, especially for little dry skin, and it saved me from hassles of applying moisturizer all over my body everyday. I just rub a small amount all over after shower, easier and better to use. It leaves your skin baby soft."
"Used it for the first time and loving the texture of the oil.
It's not that greasy. Best for skin."
Best for removing makeup
Currently using it a hair serum! Non sticky suits for daily use. 
"Use it in the night are routine or as a makeup remover does wonders to the skin . Has an added benefit of vit e which is good for skin!
"
Use for it removing makeup 
Amazing product.?
Amazing oil I am using it has makeup remover
"Wonderful oil, reduces dark marks from the face."
It works well for removing sunscreen makeup before using a face wash.

"Very good product, smeels nice üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Nice leave in oil for baby skin. But don't take too much oil, use a little.
Not greasy and nice smell."
"It clearly removes the makeup and dirt 
Perfect"
"Nice smell, skin friendly product"

Very soft and easy to clean your face loved it.
Though being a grown woman I still enjoy using this wipe on my face cuz it is not harsh and using it in the mid of the day makes the face look clean.
"We do not have any babies at home. Who uses the wipes then?
I do! Why? Because the fragrance is so soothing!
Does not harm the skin at all. It's a baby product after all!
Do I have to say more?"
I used these to clean my tattoos before applying the cream given by my tattooist. It cleaned amazing and my tattoo healed up healthy without any irritation or infections. Overall it's an all rounder
This is a great product for a sensitive skin. It makes your face soft and clean and is a must buy item for oily skin girls.
Enriched  with  moisturizing  lotion.

Got for dad. He loved it. All Nivea deos are great.

Refreshing menthol gives a great after shave experience
I bought this for my husband and he simply loved it.
I ordered this for my husband and he just loved this . 
I got it for my fiance and he absolutely loves it. This is his everyday essential need.
I gifted this aftershave to my Dad and have received only praises. It smells refreshing and is gentle on the skin. The only complain is that since the mouth is wide open a lot the product  flows out at once which is not needed. Overall its worth the buy I'm satisfied.
I gifted this to a friend and he simply loved the fragrance. It lives upto its claims of soothing and cooling.The bottle looks cute as well.
"It does the job as an aftershave cause it gives you that tingle and slight burn on the skin which is good but the fragrance is a bit like the soap you'd brind from a store and make a perfume out of it. If you want to just try a new aftershave then you can go for it but for a regular use, go for Old Spice which is the classic."
Medium.. not bad .. but not much useful.. sometimes it creates irritation and make more dry skin ..only it's fragrance is nice ..
It is so very soothing from its first use. perfect aftershave.
Finish a great shave with a fresh. Cool freshness. 
Finish a great shave with a fresh. Easy to apply and absorb.

This product is superb. Being using this product from past 4 years.
"Recently gifted it to my dad, and he loves it. It has a nice smell which makes your skin feel refreshing. I also love the packing. Overall, nice product."
Different and long Lasting fragrance according to whether.
"Nice and long-lasting I bought this for my dad, and he loved it. "
A bit dense. Fresh in a subtle way. A little on the mild side which is nice. I would prefer wearing this during the night time. I bought this along with Playboy New York and you can't really complain at this price. 
Playboy deos and perfumes is just amazing. This one is no exception. It smells nice and stays longer.
"After usage of a week my review on this product, well I am not satisfied. I don't think this one is a quality product, the perfume doesn't even last for an hour."
Needful thing
Yes thoug this are baby wipes we can also clear our makeup or makeup brushes with rhis wips.. good quality wipes
Good wipes...useful in makeup removal too
Good one.. Easy to remove makeup.. So soft n gentle 
"it is so good,  moisturizes your skin"
Nic product
Nice 
Nicee
Happy me ..
I use it most of the times when I'm out.. it makes my face look fresh 
Best product...good for skin

Although its meant for baby's but it suits senstive skin too removes all dirt in single swipe and its way better than kara
"Can be used as a baby wipe, and a perfect makeup remover as well."
"Soft, good fragrance, strong packaging "
I highly recommend this wipe to all for babies and for adults as well. I doesnot feel hard on skin and no chances of dkin rashes. Thumbs up for this product
"20 sheets in this pack.
Good According tp the range"
I always use this wipes. It can wipe out all dust from your skin.
"While these are baby wipes, I use them as makeup removers. Trust me, they remove makeup in literally one swipe, and one wipe is good enough to take off layers of makeup. They also leave the skin feeling moisturized"
People use for baby I use for makeup clean very gentle soft nd supple 
"I love Nivea since a very long time and I just love almost all the products of Nivea. It doesn't darken your underarms area which deodorants do. So, in my opinion, it is a must-buy product for summer."
"Good communication Ousm service

Delivery on time Cum"
It's amazing I hit bottom on the first one and ordered again. It's amazing and last long. It's not particularly a female product but since no women's perfume or deo lasts long enough for us to get out of the house this one's nice. It's stays on the whole day and no irritation or skin darkening.
"It's a good non irritant product, n it almost lasts upto 8hrs..."
Supper for man deodorant who hate spray deodorant. Try this product. No irritation on skin. 
The fragrance is great and long lasting. The masculine musky smell provides just the right push in the confidence.
"Long lasting upto 12 hrs with a strong, pleasant odour"
Nice does not leave white marks on your  clothes.
best best roll on.. nivea men all product the best must try
"genuine products supplied, delivery service very good, products received before eatimated delivery date. product quality was satisfactory, i like this type of service. good keep it up  "
"It has a gel texture , smell is nice it's not too strong , overall it's amazing"
"I love this roll on...this is my 4th purchase, you can go with this without any second thought. Its stay for more than 48hrs."
Ordered for my brother. Does the job pretty decently 
Its good for use... apply after shower and tada you are done  for the day... no need of getting conscious 
I bought it for my brother. It has a nice mild fragrance which may not last for a long time. But main advantage is it controls sweat and keeps you away from the body odour. 
good product awsm fragrance ......good for both girls and boys ???loving it. 
Mild fragrance and owesome deo i like it?
All are product very stunning... Delivery time is very fast....Satisfied
"Worth each penny . Also, fragrance is not that strong and helps in controlling the sweat"
I liked it ..I gifted to my friend .. he loved it. Affordable at price also 
I loved the package n products tooüòò
"No fragrance at all, only filled with gas. Waste of money."
It's a wonderful product and real worth for money. People actually notice it and ask about it. Now I am going to buy two more for my friends.
"It's a wonderful product and really worth for money.. People started asking about the good smell and whats the brand..and they say, they need it and where to buy. I have suggested Nykaa as a safe place for them to buy this product. now i am going to buy two more for my friends :)."
"It's having a different type of fragrance, very unique but it won't last long maybe 2-3 hours."
I bought this deo recently. I am in loved with the fragrance it has. It is just so uplifting!
"I ordered this for my brother.... He loves it, makes skin moisturise."
my skin is so soft and hydrated 
The consistency was good for a baby's cream. I bought it for my little brother and it smelled good too. Isn't something extraordinary but surely keeps the face moisturized for hours( as experimented on myself)
"Boutique baby products are good for baby skin,,this cream is good in winter season for babies."
The baby cream is very nice and also pocket friendly. must buy. 
Very good for sensitive skin of babies.
"Quite moisturizing, slightly oily but, gets absorbed after some time.
Mild scent, won't irritate anyone's nose. 
"
It completely suits my baby's skin.
This is my 2 purchase. Very gentle on the skin. Moisturize the skin. Smells good too. My daughter also uses this. 
Amazing natural fragrance and makes skin soft. Best for dry skin and best for daily use.
i cant imagine my day without this. ohh.. give a try girls. recomended
"I am using this as a day cream is really very mild, non-greasy cream.  After applying this, skin feels so fresh and supple. With the goodness of nature can use this every day."
"This baby cream is all that my baby wants. 
Pros:
Deep nourishment 
No chemical 
Inexpensive 
No skin reaction 
Keeps skin smooth and hydrated "
"Not greasy, not heavy, just the perfect level of moisturisation :)"
"Loved it , i use it before my makeup and it makes my base look super shinny.."
Works wonder on my baby's skin .... recommend everyone to use this for a single tym and u would luv this .
A little bit heavy on skin.not for summer and monsoon but best for winters.for dry skin .fragrance is little bit high.makes skin soft and moisturized. 
This is best for summer. It makes Skin Smooth and Moist. Perf for summer. 
"The product is such a great one, I use it for my own skin. The ingredients are all natural and it has no parabens or pthalates or sulphates. It's great and thick and provides intense moisturization. Great buy "
Honestly said the products of biotique are ammesing and the results are very good .
They are good for sarees esp because u do not want too big ones.They are medium size.
Very useful saftey pins.good quality its a must have for girls and women
The size is good. The quality is good. Overall happy with purchase
The quality was a bit less than expected but its okay for pining up light weighted materials but ignore if the material is heavy.
Got this beauty from nykaa!!! Been a big fan of avene products specifically thermal spray its gives u instant soothing feeling n reduces redness....best thing about this is it is fragrance free if u are looking for something like this go for it!!!! Holy grail of my skin care regime.... i got my 300 ml bottle which is quite large and can last you many months.....
Really soothing but less quantity according to the price 
"Is one of the main reason I love this mist is because it has no nasties, no chemicals, no fragrance and absolutely zero alcohol. In summers I find myself missing this one on my face every few hours because it genuinely hydrates my skin so well. People often say that missed do not work but this one comes my skin so much, I have gone over four bottles already and I will always keep the purchasing this!"
Avene toner is my all time favorite as it is very light weight and feels so amazing in this hot summer. It's just a bit costly that's the only Con it has.
"This is my go refresher, I always finish and start skin care with this . It never dissapoints and give me a plump skin."
Osm for summer 
A must have product. It heals like magic... some of our skin care products and trials gives us breakouts and tiny bumps..trust me this is a magic eraser for those.
love this spray sooo soo refreshing... helps alot during heat of the day
Does wonders to irritated skin. This is my 5th bottle.
Now I can‚Äôt even imagine my skin without thermale spring water. It has literally helped my skin to cope with its hyper reactive nature. It soothes my skin. Overall it‚Äôs a gud feeling.the mist is very fine .  Over a long period of time if u apply it before your moisturiser it does help with hydration levels of skin 
Works great on irritated skin! 
It works well on irritated skin. No bad reviews about this
"If you have sensitive, acne prone skin, have sunburns or irritated skin this is a savior . I just wash my face and pat dry and spray it and let it soak. Worked wonders to my super sensitive skin"
"This is really perfect for oily skin and acne prone skin. I am using this for last 6 months, my acne problem getting cured and skin also feels very fresh. "
It‚Äôs an amazing product mild soft on skin it gave relief from redness on skin even on body. It remove irritation on skin best for summer. Easy to carry while traveling love it
"Close ur eyes & buy it... U will definitely love this product.Makes my skin healthy,Instant refreshing... "
It does amazing job to my irritated n inflamed skin..
It's very good to cool your skin and keeps it hydrated.
"Finally understood why this one is a cult favorite. Does excellent does of exfoloiation without stripping away mousture. Skin feels baby soft afterwords. And the smell is to die for! Though the price is a bit high, but a must buy for a truly spa-like experience at home! "
Its first time I bought mist. Thermal water is quite good for the skin. I really liked this mist with their face wash. But not sure about buying again because of its high price. If you want some mist with this price point then blindly go for this one.. nd I would suggest to try medium size as the smaller one is quite small. I bought medium size only even if it was 1st purchase.

Always rely upon Johnson! My summer days are incomplete without this wipes. It keeps my skin hydrated
"I often use baby wipes to remove light makeup, and I have to say that Johnson‚Äôs wipes are one of the affordable ones available in the market which aren‚Äôt too harsh on the skin."
favourite skin wipes otherwise i dont use anyother skin wipes beacause they make my skin looks black but it doesn't

Excellent product for personal use. For men
" It does what it says - tick

48hrs claim- i take a bath twice a day so cant really comment on that one lol 
But, overalll Nivea never disappoint .. "
I got this for my husband and trust me it's true to what it claims. Deodorants fade after a couple of hours but it stays for long. Really a good product for fighting harsh and strong male odour.

"
"Roll-ons are way better than aerosol deodorant. Great smell, which is long-lasting and it‚Äôs the best part."
I have used Nivea protect and care (Women) but I must say this one is fantastic. Even girls can also use this Amazing. Control underarm odor and sweat. Loved this!
I m using this last 1 yr this is what i want for my daily use
Nice fragrance. Perfect for men who don't like strong deos.
I ordered it for my brother and he loved it. It has nice long lasting fragnance. It does not give irritation to the skin.
Makes ur skin oily after sometime 
I find my baby complexion has becoming dull by using this cream 
"It would have been nice if it had mild fragrance 
And its too oily "
Nothing great. Just okayish. The fragrance is a bit weird. 
I m using this as hands cream.its moisturizes well n gives non sticky texture. But can't say abt how it works on babies.
I used from 2 months ..my baby skin colour change ..not good cream
This is good one but its smell is to harsh and irritating.
Nothing is magically about it but not bad at this price.
Surprisingly heavy in the face and a very strong smell
nothing great. but isnt bad as well a normal cream
It's good for winters but I don't think it's suitable for oily skin people. I personally think that Himalaya baby cream is far better and even it brightens your face instantly and moreover prevents pimple!
"This lotion is very moisturizing and non-greasy, so it's great for use on the body, especially on hands. However, when I used it on my face, it gave me little bumps on my forehead and along my jawline (malassezia). Therefore, please don't use it on your face if you are maleassezia prone like me."
Eye is burning badle. And product is soso
"During winter, it is very good for dry skin, I like it because it keeps my children skin soft and moisture well, its not greasy keeps them looking fair all through the winter time. "
Very good face cream for babies 
Always my favourite brand biotique   Good moisturiser I brought this for myself  fragrance is mild very good for dry skin people thanksüëçüèª
It's soft and smooth 
My little brother is 6 years old he loves it.
"It's super cream I have used 8 tubes already. 
It keeps skin hydrated and coconut content gives clear bright skin.
I use it as a night cream which is very soothing."
I started using it 5 yrs ago.. now i use it as my night time hand and foot cream.. and this is THE BEST night time hand and foot cream for me..
It's a very great mist. It makes skin calming and refreshed.
"Good for redness, instantly soothes and cool down the skin. The best for dry sensitive skin."
"Using this product during summers, brings a refreshing glow on the skin and during winters keeps the skin hydrated. I would recommend its purchase. "
This product is a boon to sensitive skin beauties. My recommendation- use after refrigeration for better results
"Also, acts as a good makeup setting spray. "
"I loved this product. Soothes my skin immediately after application. Especially after walking in sun. However, it's price is its big con."
"This could be used as a primer for oily skin. I‚Äôve a T zone, therefore I use it on a particular portion only. But it helps in reducing acne build up.!"
It's a good product for sensitive skin.
"It's one of the best product. Just one spray and your skin is hydrated instantly. I use it twice  as a toner and also for those itchy, bumpy skin problems. "
This spray calms and soothes the skin very effectively. Used it after removing makeup and my skin feels refreshed and hydrated. Love it.
"I was having severe acne, but this product is a miracle. Just spray it 2-3 times a day. You will see visible results in just one week. Thank you, Nykaa, for this amazing product. "
"You name the skin care brand and I know it. Had lot of trouble due to skin problem  while growing up and then the love for skin care started this one is a boom for the sensitive skin. I have roseacia , rashes, allergies and occasional breakouts. And spraying this thermal spring water really soothes my skin and reduces rosacea."
Its a great product to keep in your purse great during travelling.
Helps a lot to control oiliness itching and burning sensation on skin.
"This doesn't dry up the skin and after researching over and over again, I've bought this toner and it is the best ever. Doesn't contain alcohol, no paraben, no sulphates!"
"I bought this product after I saw Michelle Phan using it in her Instagram Story for soothing her post-laser treated skin. I bought it right away as it was on sale in Nykaa. It really does soothe my skin after I got my chemical peel treatment. I sometimes use it as a toner too. However, the price is quite high."
Good choice for the beginner‚Äôs who are not used face sprays. This spray is gentle enough it doesn‚Äôt harm the eyes even if gets into it! Don‚Äôt cause any breakouts feels refreshing. 
Refreshing and keeps acne at bay. What else do you need!
I really loved it. It helps in soothing my skin and makes it fresh.
"I have tried it on myself as well as my friend who had severe acne problem. It simply soothes your skin, without harming them does its job. What more can you ask for. It's always in my bag whenever I am going outside in the sun. Helps soothe sunburn like a boss."
Good for skin in winters
"This is a must skin care product
Moisturizer+highlighter+face serum+gooooooodnessss....."
